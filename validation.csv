"__label__negative Expensive and unreliable. Be careful, as the price you see is not the price you pay, which was for our trip, nearly three times more! The airline changed the time of the flight to an hour and a half later, which was then delayed, jeopardising our onward journey and effectively losing us a half day of our holiday - not to mention loss of sleep over the onward connection. The on-board staff were friendly and tried to be understanding, but the ground staff were among the rudest I've ever encountered."
"__label__negative  My flight was cancelled due to the weather conditions and they informed the cancellation of the flight just 10mins before flight departure. Instead of helping us get another flight, they told us to go back to departure gate and no one was even there on the gate. And then we were told to rebook our flight online and then we were just told to leave the airport which took around 2hrs due to the security. I saw the departure of so many flights which were scheduled just within 1hrs of my flight. They could have delayed my flight maybe or at least assisted in rebooking but they chose to do nothing. Amidst this chaos, where I was still processing what was happening, I rebooked the wrong flight and I have been trying to contact the customer service but guess what no one is responding. There's no customer service at airport and they don't respond online. Wouldn't recommend the flight to anyone."
"__label__positive  A quick, efficient, friendly service from easyJet. The plane arrived on stand from a previous sector and was turned around in less than 20 minutes! The crew on board were welcoming and a credit to the airline. Only thing which let it down was the slow ground service at Belfast Int’l in unloading but not the airline’s fault. Overall, a great experience. Will definitely use easyJet for my next trip!"
"__label__negative  I was unable to go on this flight due to the COVID restrictions introduced by the German government. EasyJet refused to let me cancel or give me any kind of refund despite claiming that the flight was converted for COVID cancellations when I booked. I would absolutely not recommend EasyJet for COVID era travel, they don’t care about their customers at all."
"__label__negative Paid 533 euros, as per proof sent to Skytrax, with one change of dates, for this domestic flight of 01h20m. If this is not extortion I don't know what is. The plane was crowded, there was not enough space for baggage, the cabin was too warm, crew were Portuguese whom have become increasingly unfriendly, unnecessarily formal and even arrogant, easyJet have absorbed TAP's vicious habits in this route and what it seems their crew from 4 years ago. The resuming of flights by Ryanair on this route will put them back on their knees from where they shouldn't have left. Unfortunately they will very likely try to hijack the Regional Government with artificial arguments, which by incompetence, ignorance or dissimulation, they could concede to even more 'support', as if they needed. It is how this so called low cost airlines work. Commercial aviation needs urgent supervision by national Regulators. On a positive note which isn't enough to give them more than one star rating, their telephone support actually works and is attentive, however as per usual with airlines this may change from one day to another."
"__label__negative  Together with my husband and five-year-old son, we arrived at the airport in advance due to the purchased additional luggage (23kg) We were one of the first to check-in because many people who flew to Berlin at that time had a problem with checking in at the airport by Easy Jet at a time when other airlines (e.g. Ryanair) did not have these problems. Aweek before departure, we observed changes overnight in the restrictions introduced in Germany due to the prevailing pandemic. We have completed all the documents required by the German side so that our trip could take place. In addition, we checked the EasyJet app and EasyJet Hub every day to be sure that any additional changes would not affect our flight. The last change made to the Easyjet Hub took place on December 20. On the day of departure, the Easy jet staff responsible for boarding informed us that we would not be admitted to the flight to Berlin because we have Polish passports and we do not have a transit ticket (from Berlin Brandenburg airport to another airport). The situation was extremely stressful for us, because despite having all the necessary documents, we were refused a flight. We asked to contact the shift manager to confirm this decision, informing in advance that we had spent too much time trying to resolve the situation, which could result in the inability to change the flight (we could have changed the flight up to 2 hours before departure) we informed the staff that I am pregnant and this situation stressed me as well as my five-year-old son, yet we were told to wait for the manager's decision. After two hours, we have been informed that we would not be allowed to fly despite the documents we presented due to the fact that the staff interpreted the restrictions in their own way. We asked the staff for help in changing tickets to another flight, but we were refused help, suggesting that we could contact customer service ourselves on the number that we can find on the Internet.  I tried to call customer service to explain the situation. Unfortunately, each of our attempts to connect ended with a broken signal despite no problems with the network.  At that time, we bought a next day flight from Manchester to Krakow, we had to perform additional tests on Covid because the previous certificates."
__label__positive  Both flight on A320. Boarding at HEL was chaotic because they were checking the vaccination certificate to passengers that had check-in electronically. At BER chick in was a breeze. Boarding was done with zone system; staff were easy going not creating problems with passengers carrying larger carry-ons. In flight service on menu buy items. Overall very good for low cost airline.
"__label__negative  I booked 2 tickets 28th Dec on Easyjet, Gatwick to Geneva to go to France for New Year. I booked Easyjet insurance in case things went wrong and I could not go. I am a flightclub member. France banned UK residents from coming to France so now we cant go - we are not allowed. EasyJet will not refund the flights as they are to Switzerland not France.  Easyjet are not doing the right thing and refunding flights. I spoke to Flightclub customer service who told me I could have a voucher. But with insurance I would have to call the insurance number to get a refund. After a few days i got thru to Insurance who told me my insurance did not cover governments telling me I couldn't go to their country! I then called Flightclub back who then said no voucher was available as I was flying to Geneva - not directly into France.! So all I could get back was my taxes! If you are in a similar situation please complain as this is outrageous behaviour!"
"__label__negative I used to be a travel freak, nowadays I try to travel only at last resort and do the utmost not to. Airlines have been very proficuous on dilapidating passengers prerogatives and rights, being mostly legally unreachable, with the exception of litigious proceedings. easyJet seats are hard as rock, considerably uncomfortable, resulting in a martyrdom flight. Paid almost 162,49 euros with 3 months in advance for this recent domestic flight in Portugal of 1 hour, 20 minutes and was assigned a middle seat. You are free to take your own conclusions. Very dirty plane outside and as usual lots of dust inside for some reason that I can't explain. I must say, having used them a lot, cabin crew was much more friendly when they weren't Portuguese serving other Portuguese, which in itself is an absolute shame."
"__label__negative  The cabin staff were very rude. I am a female traveler, who is short had a cabin trolley suitcase. I had asked the cabin staff to give me a hand, as I was unable to reach the cabin baggage shelf. He was very rude, telling me that if I cannot place the bag, I am not supposed to bring the bag. And then there is an announcement, about making the flight comfortable to the passengers in all possible way. This is unacceptable. I would never ever travel again through this flight. I have asked the cabin staff to just give me a hand, which even a fellow passenger does. Along with that, the staff has made a great statement."
"__label__negative  Due to Omicron, I decided to cancel my flights for December 20th, it is now December 9th. Firstly, there is no Cancel button on the website. The online form does not include this option either. I had to call them to cancel, and even after cancelling they will not confirm it by email: no assurance of the cancellation. Secondly, even nine days prior, I will receive only the tax back. That means 90% of what I paid is lost. Absolutely poor quality process, as well as a totally overcharged penalty. "
"__label__negative  A flight I took recently was delayed 9 hours which meant staying in the departure lounge for the full duration of the delay. The delay was originally 1 hour, then 2 hours before suddenly being pushed from an 8am till 4.25pm, which also left late. I submitted an expense claims form as under EU law any delay over 2 hours is subject to compensation. The delay caused me and my wife to miss another flight and having to rebook that for the following day, an overnight stay in a hotel close to the airport, and two new PCR tests in order to travel. Easyjet accepted no responsibility for the delay and would not pay compensation for expenses which were booked before the delayed or after, surely there should be some consistency and it is almost inevitable that a 9 1/2 delay will incur further expense from travellers. I will be doing my best to avoid Easyjet going forward as this is incredibly disappointing!"
"__label__negative Never again with easyJet. The deal is never worth it! Standard hand luggage isn't accepted anymore, unless you pay an extra fee of 24 English pounds. Think twice, and choose a different airline and save yourself the trouble of missing your flight or the extra payment while boarding your flight."
__label__negative  Just flown back from Tenerife on flight EZY8704 10th November 2021 - can I just say how utterly rude the cabin crew were not to mention highly unprofessional! Only one drinks service the whole 4 hour flight then watched the head cabin crew member fill her bag with what ever she could from the plane! They basically sat on there seats the whole flight - completely disgusted and we definitely not be flying with EasyJet again - you may want to give your staff some training in customer service.
"__label__negative  On Sat 6th November I had a call from Clare (DHL) at Bristol Airport advising me DHL have identified my suitcase & Iberia took it from Fuerteventura airport to Madrid as it didn't have a tag on it. I previously complained to Easyjet as the horrid lady on Easyjet speedy booking check in at Fuerteventura airport did not put a tag on my suitcase. Clare said she has emailed Iberia & Easyjet, but no one is responding & she doesn't currently know where my suitcase is. Easyjet have not once phoned me to apologise & I have received zero customer care from Easy Jet. Easy Jet are not communicating with DHL at Bristol airport to ensure my suitcase gets returned to me. Easyjet keep using Covid as an excuse, but they shouldnt operate/fly if they cant provide customer care. I actually liked Easyjet before this incident as never had any issues, yet the way I have recently been treated by Easyjet is disgusting."
"__label__negative  I took a flight from London to Paris because it was cheap, but of course that is only a trap. As soon as I arrived to the boarding queue an employee was checking one by one, with a dataphone and a bunch of receipts, charging extra £25 to everyone that couldn’t fit hand-baggage in the space they reserve for bags. Next time I will definitely chose to travel with a company that goes upfront with the price they charge and offer a good customer experience."
"__label__positive  Very good! No problem to check in online. No problem to drop baggage (took 1 min). No problem to embark with speedy boarding (but had to put my bag to overhead bin 4 rows behind my row which then delayed my disembarkation). Nice crew. Surprisingly good legroom. Landed on time. Bag on the belt within 10 min. Again, very good!"
__label__negative  Worst airline ever. Got offboarded on 26th October flight because the plane was too heavy. They offered us money (400€). After we got offboarded they forgot my bag. The support wont give me the money. Will never fly with easyjet again.
"__label__negative  We decided to use Easyjet to fly back to the UK from Krakow and arrived at the airport in good time. We flew to Krakow with Ryanair and had all our documentation to hand and everything went without a hitch. We did notice that some passengers did not have a Locator Form but the Ryanair staff simply gave them blank forms to complete and there was not any problem. Our flight with Easyjet proved to be very different as we were returning home we thought that a Locator Form would not be required and there was no early indication of this from Easyjet ground staff. As we were checking in the Easyjet staff asked for our locator forms and bluntly told us to complete them online. This meant filling in a lengthy form and also finding the 2 day PCR test reference number, which we did with some effort and succeeded in checking in just in time. We were last on the plane and others who failed to produce a locator form missed their flight. Easyjet ground staff were completely indifferent. There was no indication given at any early stage which would have given us time to leisurely complete the paperwork. This was in marked contrast to Ryanair staff who made the flight effortless for everyone."
__label__negative  The rating could have been better if they didn't use terminal 2 in Lisbon which looks and feels like a slaughterhouse and where passengers are made to endure accordingly. Fellow passengers also didn't make the trip any easier. I was just so desperate to get out of that airplane.
"__label__negative I had to buy 2 more tickets to get back to Ireland. I missed the first flight due to all trains from Victoria being stopped due to a poor soul who jumped in front of a train. EasyJet's policy is you lose the ticket and are required to buy a new ticket. Fine, I did that at the cost of 85 pounds. When I arrived at the gate for the second flight I realized I left my purse at security. The two gate agents would not call security and they would not give me the number for security. Hence I missed another flight at this point it became a comedy show due to the incompetence of EasyJet personnel, this was from the manager to a supervisor to customer service people who are clueless. Long story short me along with another couple who missed the flight because they were held in security needed to buy another ticket. This cost 110 pounds because they failed to inform us that if you don’t buy the ticket with more than two hours prior to the flight you have to pay their exorbitant fee of 110 versus 85. Then it took a manager and two supervisors 30 minutes to print my boarding pass. The incompetence of EasyJet personnel is laughable. "
"__label__positive  Another excellent flight with Easyjet. Airport was busy but all went smoothly with no delays. Paperwork checked at the gate by very helpful and pleasant gate staff. Flight was full and departed on schedule and landed early in Alicante. First class service provided onboard by the cabin crew, very helpful and professional. Aircraft was clean and the cabin crew made regular announcements regarding face masks onboard. Arrivals in Alicante was great as no waiting about and all the E-gates in use. All relevant information like boarding gate and luggage belt was provided on the easyjet app which is useful."
"__label__negative  Easyjet cancelled my return trip only 10 minutes after I landed in Milan without any explanation. Most probably they wanted to make sure to get the money of the first flight for then provide a lower compensation. I tried to book the return ticket with another airline but prices were astronomic, therefore my only option was choose the return flight provided by easyjet (for free) and shorten my holidays of over 1 day. It was a long weekend so it meant literarily spending half of the time expected. It was not because they cancelled the flight, but simply because of the very short notification that made impossible for me to find other suitable options for my needs. Greedy and unprofessional. Very upsetting!"
"__label__negative This is the worst airline we ever flew with. First flight was 1 hour late without any notification so we were standing for 1 hour and waiting with no explanation at all. The second flight was cancelled 30 mins before departure, it was complete chaos as we had to stay overnight in Italy as they scheduled the replacement flight to be at 7am which meant we had to be in the airport at 5am, this was very inconvenient for us for many obvious reasons. They did cover the hotel expense but frankly the reason we are not happy is because the airline lied about the weather conditions being bad so that we would not be eligible for any kind of flight refund other than overnight hotel stay. How do we know they lied? Simple, other airlines kept flying and the weather in Milan was quite ok, not rainy or windy. Other reasons we were unhappy? We checked in our bag before departure and since the flight was cancelled we had no information whatsoever about where we can get our bag back , in addition to the fact that we didn't have any other information on what to do already 10 pm in a city where we never been before. They only told us to find a hotel and they will refund for which we had to search all over the airport and wait for such a long time to get this information."
"__label__positive  This morning 26th September I flew BRS to GIB. The staff at check in were most kind, patient and courteous. A special mention, for Rosie who was a credit to the airline helping an older lady through the regulation and rigours of check in. I fly to Gibraltar several times a year and will continue to do so with Easyjet."
"__label__negative  The staff at the check-in was rude. As a couple, we were carrying one small cabin luggage that was the appropriate size for the aircraft as outlined on the company‘s website. The check-in staff started a discussion and insisted that we pay additional 29€ for the suitcase. Not only was she rude in the way she conveyed it, she involved other staff to apply even more pressure. In the end we paid, as the staff started threatening us to not let us on board. The general perception of easyjet has never been good.  I usually stay away from writing any reviews, however easyJet staff is rude and renders a bad experience. Luckily, I am not dependent on using easyjet, which is why I will not book another flight with you. "
"__label__negative  Upon arrival at the gate in Crete, they charged €29 for a handbag trolley although it's the size approved on their website. Many of the passengers protested, but they were threatening that they would just leave without us, we were forced to pay for 6 persons €174. Funny thing is that when you paid you could take you trolley on board! Never again flying with this airline."
"__label__negative  On Friday 13th August at roughly 20.00hrs our flight from Gibraltar to Gatwick was cancelled due to fog. After waiting another hour in the departure lounge, we were informed ‘Easyjet have been unable to find an alternative route or accommodation for the night. Please leave the airport by Gate number 5 and arrange your own accommodation’. After a frantic search online it did appear that all the hotels in Gibraltar were full. We were able to make contact with the host of the AirBNB that we had been staying at for the previous three nights and although his AirBNB was full, he made space for us in another property and charged us £160 for the emergency one nights stay. We took a taxi to his place and stayed the night. During the night we received an email from EasyJet informing us that our flight would take place at 18.00 the following day, 14th August. We therefore had to spend another whole day in Gibraltar. Obviously, we needed to eat and drink for our additional time there. At the end of this extra day, we took another taxi back to Gibraltar airport and thankfully our next flight left on time. A few days later we submitted an expenses claim to Easyjet for 2 x taxi transfers, 1 night’s accommodation and for meals and drinks during the day we were delayed. Easyjet have agreed to pay for one of our taxi journeys only! They have stated – the second taxi expense did not show a ‘route’ on the receipt so they will not pay. The food and drinks receipts we submitted were not itemised so they will not pay. The accommodation receipt did not have a date stamp on it (even though it was dated the 14th August the day after we should have gone home) so they will not pay. Easyjet flight cancellation actually cost us £289.00 and they have agreed to reimburse us £20! Not only did they treat us like animals and leave us stranded at Gibraltar airport with nowhere to stay, but when we claimed our valid expenses they have done everything in their power to wriggle out of paying. Next time I fly to Gibraltar I will 100% travel with British Airways. "
"__label__negative There was no direct flight options on a daily basis to our destination and unfortunately easyJet was our only option. Knowing that we will have to pay for the baggage! After paying for the baggage, they charged us again for the carry on bags that are always allowed in the cabin (mine at least been to 100 flights at least). This didn’t make any sense, we paid 70 euro for the ticket but ended up paying 90 euro for the baggage (60 for the actual luggage and 30 for the carry on) I never check in my carry on cause of the valuable stuff such as laptop and jewellery. Worst customer service ever. Never flying with easyJet."
"__label__negative  I was supposed to return to London via EasyJet and I was denied boarding due to a PCR test. Although I had checked twice since booking the ticket in June. The requirements changed again so fully vaccinated passengers required a PCR to enter the UK. However, the government requirements also stated that if passengers were fully vaccinated but did not have a PCR test they could enter the UK but would be subject to a £500 fine. The option of a fine was never given to me. When I asked for the customer service representatives name she refused. When I asked to speak with a manager she refused. I have never seen an airline which lacked so much accountability or with lower customer service levels. If you choose to travel with Easyjet and you run into trouble you are on your own. "
__label__positive Overall my flight with TUI was great. Captain and crew were very informative and friendly and had a comfortable flight to Gran Canaria. I sat on seat 17a which I picked and the seat was reasonably comfortable for a 4 hour flight and this flight was meant to be on 737-800 and for a picky person into aviation this was a huge bonus as we were given TVs. Food and drink was offered however I got myself a Burger King prior to the flight however I did get a Diet Coke on the flight - forgot the price. We landed in quite hard and my favourite bit - the airport. Getting through the first part of immigration was fast and easy but when we had to joint the vaccination/covid test line which had 2 desks and 4 flights that was terrible. Then the baggage we had to wait almost 2 hours for due to a mix up made us even more tired and stressed. Anyway the general flight was great and I praise TUI and their crew.
__label__positive  This was my 4th time with TUI! This flight was probably my best flight with them as the crew were absolutely great and we were on a 787-9 Dreamliner on a 3.45 minute flight. My only issue was boarding took ages and were using 1 bus but that’s not TUIs problem. We landed 1 hour late but that was fine with me. Baggage at Birmingham took 45 mins which is not very good- Overall a great experience.
"__label__negative  On our flight no. TB181 from Brussels to Punta Cana on 15/08/2021, we sat in the Deluxe section and while the flight crew was very nice, a lot of passengers either weren’t wearing any masks at all and only had them hanging from their chins, or some just had them on to cover their mouths but not their noses. On such a long flight, I expected to see everyone wearing their masks correctly (except for eating & drinking, but people were not wearing their masks (correctly) for hours). The flight crew didn’t say anything, only when I asked them directly they managed to ask a woman in front of us to put on her mask. She did, but as soon as the flight attendant was gone, she made an obscene gesture towards a sign that told the passengers to wear masks and proceeded to free her nose. When we in process of landing, one of the flight attendants was standing directly in front of us, next to us was a man that didn’t wear any mask at all and loudly talked to his neighbour in the middle row. Both didn’t wear their masks, but the flight attendant didn’t say anything at all. I am very disappointed with the crew and especially with TUI fly for not enforcing basic hygiene rules despite the Covid-19 pandemic still going on. I will not be flying with Tui again despite having flown with them for years and I regret already having booked the return flight to Brussels because this shows the company doesn’t care for their passengers’ safety at all. To be truthful, I was horrified at how little the crew seemed to care - they were busy chatting next to the kitchen while half the plane was sitting without masks."
"__label__negative  After several times contacting the customer services of this company, I am still waiting for an answer about why I didn't get the email cancellation before arriving at the airport, it cost me more than £150 to get the refund of my tickets. All the times I tried to contact customer services by phone (by email was impossible as they never send emails back), they hung up the phone without any reason. I can say that this company is the worst I ever seen, they are unprofessional and irresponsible."
"__label__positive  This was our first time flying with TUI airways (UK) and we were surprised by the standard of service offered in this restricted time with the corvid restrictions. The boarding at Gatwick was done in a corvid safe manner and the cabin crew explained that a face mask had to be worn for the duration of the flight and whist in the arrival airport in Corfu. The Cabin Services Manager explained that due to Corvid there movement in the cabin was to be kept to a minimum and there would only be the 2 rear toilets in customer use and teh=at there was only t be a maximum of 4 passengers standing at any one time, also the there would only be one cabin service of food and drinks. We were given regular updates form the cockpit which were clear and friendly. The pilots pointed out places of interest on the route down to Corfu. Arrival at Corfu and deplaning was well organised and the Cabin Crew controlled the exit of the aircraft onto the waiting coaches. The flight back to Gatwick was an evening flight and again the Cabin Service manager explained that there were only 2 rear toilets for customer use and there would only be one drinks service. However, there was a tax free trolley has well on this flight has the banned had been lifted. Again, we had informative updates from the cockpit and were als able to follow the route on the drop down TV cabin Screens. On landing into Gatwick the exiting was well controlled by rows and seemed to be well practiced by the crew.. The onboard menu is very similar to other offered and is very reasonable in price and the food and drinks purchased was very good value for money. We did pay the extra for an extra legroom seat which was a good investment and there was plenty of legroom. Yes we would fly TUI airlines again and found the product to be excellent value for money."
"__label__negative  When you book the flights on TUI website, it takes your seat upgrade money before it shows you what seats are available and what extra space you get for your money, which is wrong! After booking and paying, it said we only get extra 2 inches legroom for (£78 for 2 people). When I changed it, I was then charged a £40 amendment fee. I was basically charged £84 just to choose a standard seat, when Easyjet would be £16. The selfish TUI airline staff also shut the front aircraft toilets to public and kept it to themselves, and all people on aircraft had to use rear toilets. When I complained to TUI about people queueing in aisle and standing over me, I was lied to and told all airline companies have done the same during Covid 19 pandemic, which is a lie as Easyjet kept all toilets open to public on flight in same week. When I complained to TUI their response was the most unsympathetic, unapologetic customer service response I have every received. I will never book a holiday or fly with TUI again."
"__label__negative  Gatwick to Enfidha. We were denied check as we were 4 minutes late this morning and have now been told we will lose our package holiday. This is absurd we were late by 4 minutes only, plenty time to clear customs and board, minutes late and this is how we have been treated. Told to deal with it with your insurance company."
"__label__positive  Due to Storm Ciara our flight was delayed by several hours and then we flew to East Midlands airport with onward coaches arranged to Gatwick. The Captain, came into the cabin many times to keep us updated at every stage and to answer any questions. He also offered trips/pics in the cockpit. The crew were great too. Nothing was too much trouble. We would like to pass on our appreciation for the great communication during a difficult time."
"__label__negative  Booked a holiday to Kos on a Boeing 787 with TUI. ended up saying it was switched to Norwegian which is fine but then a month before booking was told we would be on one of three other airlines which eventually was Smartlynx. The Smartlynx plane we were flown on was plain white, 25 years old and cramped more than ive ever experienced. The table when down literally gave you no space at all, I cant image what its like for taller/ larger people. I appreciate there can be some changes to the plane (as per T&C's!!) but to move us from a new bigger aeroplane when we also had extra legroom to help with two young children to a small old cramped plane is unacceptable. They just don't compare. I wont book with them again as you cant rely on them to just change what you booked and not even a fair like for like change!"
"__label__negative  Stansted to Tenerife. TUI has the worst customer service. We flew with them in July and our flight was delayed over 24 hours - we were never given an explanation and no one in Tui seemed to know what was going on - it was totally chaotic. We lost a days holiday and have tried to contact them to complain but it is impossible to get hold of them! We have phoned, emailed, even emailed the Chief Exec - nothing! We will keep going but seriously don’t fly with them they are rubbish."
"__label__negative Operated for TUI by Olympus, this was one of the shabbiest aircraft's I’ve ever flown on. The interior looked like it needed a good scrub, my seat cushion and that of my husband next to me kept coming away and the armrest to the left of my seat was missing making it very uncomfortable (the visible metal to which it should have attached had been covered with a bit of silver tape). One of toilets also had no water in the taps. We paid for and got extra legroom next to the emergency exit but the seats didn’t recline and were so thinly padded they were uncomfortable. As the flight wasn’t full some others were moved to similar seats across the aisle but cabin crew failed to explain to them(as they did to us) what to do in the unlikely event of needing to evacuate via that exit (surely a breach of safety regulations). The jump seat in front of us was filthy and what looked like old tissues fell out when the crew member opened it. The Olympus crew were reasonably friendly and smart unlike the Tui staff who were completely offhand, surly and seemed only interested in selling. They certainly didn’t understand customer experience. Definitely not recommended."
"__label__negative  Manchester to Tenerife South. From check in to arrival at the destination, everything about this flight was awful. The staff at Manchester airport check in were unfriendly and gave the impression they were doing you a favour being there at all. The cabin crew spent the first 20 minutes having a gossip with each other and sharing drinks. They were surly and scruffy (one cabin crew member had a skirt with the hem coming undone) and were only interested in selling, food, drinks and scratch cards. There was nothing resembling customer service. We paid for extra legroom seats which offered no extra legroom at all because the aircraft type was changed before departure. We didn’t buy the on board food but those nearby who did ended up with something resembling a dish sicked up by a dog. This is truly the worst airline I have flown with and definitely won’t be repeating the experience"
__label__negative  Cardiff to Palma. Had to pay extra £50 to sit next to relative which wasn't explained during booking. Flight delayed. Put on ASL Airline not TUI. Got diverted to Toulouse. TUI unable to get fuel there as no contract to do so. This led to further delay. All in all the experience was awful. I would not recommend TUI.
"__label__negative  Thessaloniki to Birmingham. I had the worst customer experience with TUI services. I made the mistake to book a flight with them and they do not offer a check in online service (they advertise they do but their app, web page, customer support service is completely useless). I tried several times to contact them and complete my check in but no one was willing to help or even explain. Finally I arrived at the airport approximately 2 hours before my flight but I was not allowed to check in, although I didn't have any check in bags and my flight was delayed. As I result I missed my flight and I faced rudeness and sarcasm from TUI staff. Don't waste money or time to them."
"__label__negative  Dublin to Kos. For the first time in my life I met such dirty plane. It's not that it has not been cleaned after the previous flight, it's dirt from a few months. Terrible food - cold and pale toast with ham. Cabin crew okay. I would like to say: never again, but I have to return with them"
"__label__positive  Doncaster to Menorca. I'm a very scared flyer and the pilots were amazing. They explained the route and weather conditions, and why and when the Aircraft would be turning to approach for landing. I'm really worried about the different noises in the plane and the reassurance from the pilots really made a difference. Very impressed. Thank you."
__label__negative  Rhodes to Dublin. On way back we stood in line for 2 hours to check in. Then again for hour for security check. Then probably another hour for passport control before boarding. We were three hours early but flight ended up an hour late. Elderly and disabled stood for 3 hours. 
__label__negative  Manchester to Phuket. Very disappointed with TUI. Long Haul Flight Only includes no check in luggage. 7kg hand luggage is the only allowance included in advertised cost. It is then £35 each way for up to 20kg. It is then £16 to choose a seat. The check in is very long process. Waited 1hr 40 minutes as only 2 desks open for economy. No one checked my hand luggage for size and weight so their policy is void therefore a money making misleading scam. On board the staff were brash and let’s say tired looking shouting out “prosseco £20 Prosecco £20” Entertainment was laughable. Hardly anything to watch. Food mediocre. Toilets! Obviously not checked as smell of urine was strong and tissue not replenished. The whole experience was way below par. Never again.
"__label__positive  Birmingham to Cancun. Had a great flight, the cabin crew were very helpful and looked after us throughout the flight.  It was a great start to our holidays and am looking forward to our return flight"
"__label__positive  Lanzarote to Birmingham. Great flight with TUI. Served lovely snacks, and had great in-flight deals. This is the second time I've flown with TUI, the first in December 2017 to Fuerteventura (also from BHX). Pilot gave us speeches, and handled the take-off and landing pretty well. I would definitely recommend it to other people wanting to travel to the Canaries. Unfortunately no wifi, but that may be the type of aircraft I flew."
"__label__positive  Boa Vista to Manchester. I cannot praise TUI flight staff high enough either going out to Boa Vista on 31st Jan 2018 or coming back on 7th Jan. They were all so polite and friendly and nothing was too much trouble and certainly helped the long flight pass. On the way out a passenger took ill and this was dealt with efficiently and very calmly and the only reason we new about it was because a doctor was sitting in front of us and was asked for his help. I have difficulty walking so had ordered a wheelchair from the cabin to the baggage collection which didn't turn up and the whole crew waited with me and my family until it came, despite me telling them to go home they all refused, even the captain. Tui should be proud of having such exceptional staff managing their planes and dedication to looking after the passengers. I have booked holidays with Tui many times and they are always our preferred choice and will remain so."
"__label__positive Bristol to Orlando Sanford. We have been travelling to Florida for many years but have been using TUI exclusively over the last few visits for the following reasons. They use Orlando Sanford which our preferred airport to arrive and depart from due to its size and speed to travel through. The planes they use are relatively new against Virgin 747s (Over 30 years old) and BA 777 (20 plus years old). Leg room is generous for economy. Flights are generally on time, with the last visit in September 2018, both flights pushed back early. The food is okay for airline fare, with plenty of drink runs by the crew. Overall we have been very happy with TUI (and its predecessor Britannia) and will probably look to book with them again on our next visit. Well done TUI."
