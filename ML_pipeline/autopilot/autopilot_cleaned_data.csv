0,"Do not fly Ryanair if you have children! Their website states you are allowed a carry on baby changing bag - yet staff wanted to put my baby’s milk / nappies etc in the hold. I also paid priority boarding to allow me to take on my fold up buggy into the cabin but I was refused this and threatened to be thrown off the flight. My changing bag and buggy were both within restrictions given on Ryanair’s website. Not only that, but when I disputed this, the air crew then refused to serve myself, my 10 month old baby, 2 year old and 3 year old for the entire 4 hour flight. They would not even take our rubbish. I was flying solo with my 3 children and they made our experience so stressful. They are unhelpful, with no understanding or compassion for their passengers. Other passengers were also saying how ridiculous it was given that I had paid for the baggage and I was flying solo. It was my first experience with Ryanair, and my last.",negative
1,"I tried to place booking at 23.03.2022 via ryanair iOS app but got error on payment step, then returned to main screen. After few seconds I was billed and I decide that it was mistake and wait that this withdrawal will cancel. But it was not happened. Than, i try to place booking again and it was success. I ask my bank about first withdrawal, why it was not canceled and they ask me to contact with Ryanair support. I did this and it turned out that in fact in the first case the reservation was placed! But not any information about it. So I  have two identical reservation and ask to refund one of them. Now passed almost two weeks and it still not refunded. I have to spend a lot of time to contact with support and so on. So when you bill me - it is few seconds but to got refund i have to wait weeks.",negative
2," Terrible customer service and non-existent communication As a US resident, I had the bad experience of being stuck in isolation in Italy because of covid. As a consequence, I was unable to make it for my Ryanair flights within Italy. I tried to reach out to the company several time to inform them about my situation. After several attempts using some kind of useless robot on their website and talking to representatives on the phone, they don't seem to have or want to put in place any customer-friendly measures in this already stressful situation. I felt totally helpless and I am socked by how they dealt with the situation. I would recommend you use low-cost airlines other than Ryanair for your next trips.",negative
3,"I bought a 10 kg roll on hand luggage for 24.50€ for both outward and return journeys, when I booked my flights, but hours before leaving I checked my app to see that I was only allowed one small bag and if I brought another bag to the gate I would be charged 69€! Rather than facing a showdown at the gate in the early hours of the morning, I chose not to fly.",negative
5,"The last time I am ever going to fly with them. When arriving at the airport for check in, there was only one member of staff on the relevant desks and so a lengthy wait was needed before we got to speak to them. By the time we did speak with them, she informed us that we had just missed the check in period and each ticket was now to be charged £55 in order to check in. The total of £110 was as expensive as the actual flight tickets, if not more. The late check in was primarily due to the understaffing at the Ryanair counter at Stansted and not to any poor time keeping or organisation on our part. After reluctantly paying this extortionate fee (what other choice did we have?), we then proceeded through security and on to our gate. Once we boarded the plane however, there was than a 1 hr 45 min delay to our flight where we sat on the tarmac and waited. Having been charged £110 just moments earlier for being late and then being delayed for almost 2 hours really angered me. The late check in fee was entirely unnecessary and immensely overpriced in the first place, but what with our flight being delayed, it then also proved to be completely redundant. It seems that I was deemed late and charged, but they can be four or five times as late as I was deemed to be and get away with it.",negative
6,We were travelling with our 1yr old baby. We could not check-in online for some reason. We arrived at the airport 2h10 before but time to queue (very long queue) we arrive at the desk 1h30 before the flight and then we had to pay 110 euros for manual check-in (for what is this 55 euros fees I don't know but does not seems fair). Then we queue (again very long queue at the security check-in) and we run to get to the gate. There someone says we only have a FFP2 masks and need a FFP3 mask. Anyway we just want to get on the flight so we go to buy some FFP3 masks at the nearby shop (which actually are FFP2 but much more thick). We are then allowed to enter the flight and noticed that all of the Ryanair employees on board have a simple mask (same as we had before we were refused). Flight was okay even though the seats are really uncomfortable. Thank god it was only 1h30 flight. Anyway last time I fly with them. I prefer to pay 300 euros more and not have to go through all this.,negative
7,"My wife, myself and our three daughters age 3,5&9 flying back to uk from Faro. My youngest daughter had an accident in the departure lounge and we ended up missing the 20 minute deadline to board the plane by 3 mins. The irony being we’d been sat in the departure lounge waiting for the flight to board for over 30 mins. There was no way they would let us on the plane and they ceremoniously told us this in front of 300 people flying on the adjacent flight. My wife and eldest daughter in tears. My youngest not sure what’s going on. All in all 10 hours later we got back to the UK, Stansted instead of Birmingham. We hired a car at 1am in the morning and drove home to Gloucestershire. I drove to collect my car from Birmingham airport the next day. £900 mistake overall. Ryanair charged us £500 of that just to adjust the 5 tickets regardless of age. The one saving grace was the good will of the passengers that moved their seats to help us sit together. My distain for this airline can only be described in words I can’t possibly write in this review.",negative
8,"Regular Ryanair customer. Flew back from Alicante on Friday 18 th March 2022 into Shannon. Perfect flight and landed 15 minutes early. But wanted to commend a few things. The cabin crew were excellent, very professional. The landing was so smooth I didn’t realise we where on the ground. But I do wish to single out the senior flight attendant. I was carrying some duty free as well as my 10 kg case which was heavy. The steps off the plane were steep which normally I’ll cope with. But I asked this young man if I could leave my case till I get down the steps and then come back up and get it. Not at all he said I’ll take down for you. He was a gentleman. I thanked him and he said it was his pleasure. One final thought it was the first time I heard senior cabin crew thank his colleagues for their help and hard work during flight. Nice touch I thought. I know this man was not Irish but thanked the passengers for flying Ryanair in Irish. Excellent. To be commended. Well done Ryanair customer service.",positive
9,"This was the first time I have flown with Ryanair for years, after previous bad experiences, and I only flew as it was part of a package deal. It’s not that much cheaper than other airlines, which would give a better experience. The boarding process was the worst I have ever experienced. We were second in the priority queue and ended up, passing through the gate and waiting at the bottom steps waiting for a bus for ages, then we were one of the first to board the bus. We then had to wait on the bus at the bottom of the aircraft for ages, and when we got off the bus, surprise surprise we were now much further from the front. This is Ryanair priority boarding. Pretty much everyone on the flight had priority boarding, but it only gets you priority onto the bus. This is not really priority. The staff were very good, the food offerings were poor, and the seat is bolt upright, with no adjustment, and no storage. The seat is only really suitable for an hour or two flight, not four hour’s. We were at the furthest possible gate in Tenerife, and arrived into the furthest possible gate in Dublin. This is typical of Ryanair. The ultimate in no frills.",negative
10,"Worst customer service experience I have ever had. We arrived an hour and a half before departure and went to check in. Ryanair only had two employees. One member of my company and I were denied our COVID certification due to a difference in Italian rules we were unaware of, which was fair, except we were leaving the country to go to the UK where we were in line with the rules. Regardless the staff sent us to the basement to buy a COVID rapid test. Within 20 minutes we were upstairs again with our results, but the two employees had closed the check in counter, after they had told us to run downstairs to get a test and then come back for our boarding passes. We couldn’t get our passes online because it directed us to the ticket counter, but the ticket counter had stranded us. The rest of our party had headed through security while we got our tests and approached the Ryanair staff on that side and told them our dilemma. They told us to obtain our boarding passes online, which we couldn’t do because it directed us to the ticket counter. They told us we had to book new flights because no one was at the check in counter. We were early enough we would have made the flight had someone been at the check in counter to simply print our passes (as we had checked in online). Our party members talking with the employees at the gate talked with them for 50 minutes trying to get them to send someone to log in but they refused. During that conversation we informed the Ryanair representatives that one of the stranded members was prone to seizures and was out of their medication (which was in England. They simply hadn’t brought extra) and needed to be on the flight to get her medication. The staff was unresponsive, with the manager also refusing to get our passes and when told about the seizure situation was told that if they seized “we would have to take them to a hospital”. After no help those of us that were stranded found a hotel and arrived there before the flight took of, as it departed 50 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Absolutely the worst experience. We will never fly Ryanair again.",negative
12, Worst experience. So many hidden fees. Had to pay expensive fines for problems that was not my mistake. Rude staff and not comfortable flight.,negative
13,"Ryanair puts profits above people. I have over half the symptoms of covid, contacted them to try and cancel my flight and they told me there are no refunds under any circumstances. They want me to fly today and potentially infect other people so they don't have to refund me $165. This company, worth almost 26 billion dollars, wants me to fly today potentially with covid so they don't have to refund me.",negative
14,"Beware of the latest scam - 3rd party services booked on the Ryanair website: I was flying from London to Malaga and, when I purchased extra hold luggage the day before I flew, I decided to, at the same time, also buy a ticket for National Express from Victoria coach station to Stansted airport. I did so and paid one amount on my credit card, but I received no confirmation of the National Express booking, so I called NE and they had no record of my booking or payment. I did so again the next morning - still no record, so I had to buy the ticket again at a higher price. I tried to call Ryanair, but could not get through to them, nor had any success with their ""live"" chat. After arriving in Malaga I tried to get a refund from Ryanair, whom I had paid, but they said that I needed to get this from NE and that it had nothing to do with them as NE were a third party service provider. All my explanations that I had paid Ryanair and NOT NE were ignored. So I called NE again and they still said that they had no record of the reservation or payment, so I had to make a claim against my credit card company for a refund. All this took several hours of my time and was incredibly stressful. It was a relatively small amount, but I was incensed by Ryanair's approach and determined to get my money back. They are truly shocking in their customer service.  Only fly with them if there is NO alternative, even if other airlines are more expensive. Only buy the most basic/cheapest ticket and only upgrade or buy extras (seat choice, hold luggage, food, etc) as late as possible and just before your flight - in case there is a change of plan or cancellation, then your refund amount is much lower. Never purchase 3rd party services from their website - car rental, coach travel, hotels, etc. If there is a problem then they will screw you. I hope that this will help others to not make the same mistake in future",negative
15,"This airline is worse than any cheap airline in the US. They make their money for sure by us having to pay a lot of money on bags. I ended up paying nearly $500 going from Madrid to Rome and back which was nearly 3 times what I paid for the ticket. Mind you, this was a bag that only weighed 26kg which was almost 60lbs. No food or drinks served on the aircraft for free. Terrible service at the check in and terrible service on the plane.",negative
16,"2 hour wait in line, problems with online check-in, paid 275 euro check-in fee despite technical difficulties on website and was told to ask for a refund. When I asked for a refund I was repeatedly told that I should have chatted with support instead of asking for help at the airport. Extremely unhelpful, rude, and takes advantage of customers in the stressful hours before their flight. Worst flight ever, won't fly Ryanair again.",negative
17,The flight from Poznan to Birmingham was most enjoyable flight. We fly 3-4 times a month but never received service like this.,positive
18,"Let me make it short. Near on time departure early arrival. Super friendly check in as security staff at Charleroi airport (love Belgian hospitality). Fantastic crew on airplane giving very professional service so much so that one of the ladies airline stewardesses took care of a baby while her mother went to the restrooms. Perfect service for a very cheap price, Ryanair I am a very satisfied customer.",positive
19,Departure delayed for 45 minutes. Flight returned after 10 minutes to Stockholm due to a technical issue. Long queues at both the check-in counter and baggage check. Far-away terminal (Terminal 5 at Stockholm for departure). Aircraft not from Ryanair.,negative
20,"We are originally from Singapore & arrived in Frankfurt on Dec 15, 2021. We had booked a Ryanair flight to travel from Frankfurt to Catania on Dec 17, however, on Dec 16 we received news that the Italian govt has imposed an entry restriction on leisure travelers who had been in Singapore within the last 14 days. Since we suddenly became unable to enter Italy, we had to remain in Germany for the rest of Dec & cancel our trip to Catania. We tried to cancel our Ryanair tickets for flight FR 1558 and request for a refund for 321.96 € on Dec 16 but to no avail. We are very disappointed and what’s worse is I was told by Ryanair that its refund policy does not cater for flights that are not cancelled by the airline but I could pay 180 € to change my tickets before the flight took off on Dec 17. Since we will not be in Europe after Dec to use the new tickets, a refund would be the only feasible option. It has been extremely troubling & thoroughly stressful for us since Ryanair wouldn’t try to help us with the refund.",negative
21, Ryanair refuse to give a refund or voucher for not being able to fly due to Covid. They say they have a fare change system in place but you end up paying more than just buying new flights. They are incentivising people to travel with Covid and something should be done to stop them. I had already booked future flights with them but I will be boycotting them from now on.,negative
22,"Following the confinement, I asked to cancel my flight since we no longer have the right to travel. Ryanair refused to exchange my flight for a voucher or refund. This is not supposedly their problem.  Suite au confinement, j'ai demander a annuler mon vol vu que nous n'avons plus le droit de voyager. La compagnie Ryanair a refusé d’échanger mon vol en bon d'achat ou remboursement. Ce n'est soit disant pas leur problème.",negative
23," Very poor customer service, low interpersonal skills. It is very important to pay attention to your luggage. Trying to cheat on the size of the suitcase to get more money.",negative
24," The passenger behind refused to wear mask for entire flight. Their actions endangered everyone on the flight, passengers, attendants and pilots. The staff repeatedly told the passenger follow health guidelines and they refused. Do not fly with company. Your personal health and safe is not a priority with this company. This company obviously puts profits before the health and welfare of its staff and clients. I will never fly with this airline. Why, we’re passenger aloud to Jeopardize the health of the flight? Why were the authorities not informed, and had these passengers charged and fined? These passengers should be put on the do not fly list and never allowed to fly with Ryanair again. The health and welfare of passenger should be the first priority and it obviously that did not happen. Word of caution, choose any other airline but this one.",negative
25,"There is no word in the English language that can fully describe how bad this airline is. I’ve had my shares of bad experience with Ryanair but always thought “Well, my bad I should have been more prepared I guess” or “they are probably having a bad day, cut them some slack” etc. But if you’re going to be aggressive and verbally abusive to two senior travelers, then we’re going to have a real problem. Even more if the seniors in question are my parents who have a limited knowledge of English. My parents came to visit us this weekend. They arrived in London fully prepared, vaccinated, passports, forms, VeriFly app literally everything that was required and asked of them. They flew in with BA at Heathrow and everything went smoothly (take some notes Stansted!). Then we prepared their return journey and they made sure to book 2 handbags (that’s how it works now you have to pay for handbags too). So, prior to the trip they booked two ‘less than 10 kg handbags’ on the agency’s website which gave them also the right to priority board (something they were not aware of). They actually waited and queued until it was time to board and once in front of the person at the desk were asked to pay £90 for the two bags. My dad tried to explain he already paid for it, but she didn’t want to hear it, she laughed to their faces because they tried to explain themselves with the few English words they know, and then she realized that my dad speaks Spanish (apparently, she did too) so they managed to understand each other to some extent. She lost patience and told my parents it was either they paid for the bags, or they had to leave them behind. Scared and tired by the situation they decided to pay and after they got the confirmation and the sticky tag on their bags asked if they could get an invoice or receipt. The lady said she didn’t have it and that they will receive it by email. However never confirmed it with my dad and asked them to quickly move towards the plane and embark. Then someone - I'm guessing who's a security person - yelled at them in the corridor in English (remember a language they don't understand) and kept screaming and shouting at them for a good minute without thinking they might not be able to understand his language. Literally no patience, no kindness, no respect. My parents managed to connect the dots and gathered that he wanted them to leave the bags outside the plane (remember small handbags less than 10 kg) they pointed a corner to him, and he let out some kind of agreeing grunt. Then once on board they probably were thinking they could finally relax, but no, once again someone with a lot of empathy and sympathy decided otherwise. The hostess that day kept asking my mum to remove her jacket, and put it up in the overhead bin, then underneath the seat, then finally take it back and put it on her knees because it wasn’t right, and every 5 minutes came back to check if she was ""cooperating"" because she also asked my mum to remove her scarf and for some reason it needed to be left with the jacket. What is wrong in your head? When a lady of a certain age is cold, you pressure her into removing her clothes? First, I don’t get what the security hazard is with a scarf. Second, it’s literally freezing outside, and we know how cold it can be inside the plane before take-off, also ever heard of covid. I mean come on. I'm curious to know if they provide the same type of care to all their passengers.",negative
26,"I wish I could rate as -1000! Numerous times extra fees, uncomfortable seat, terrible customer service (I don’t even know if it does exist). Ryanair ruined my holiday trip. I've never been so disrespected in my whole life. Feel like I was robbed.",negative
27,"This morning with priority we arrived on the front of the queue and there was this lady who said we were not allowed to go on board because we needed a PCR test and she asked us to book another flight. We showed her our full vaccination, boarding pass, day 2 lateral flow test and she said she was sure we needed a PCR test. We asked to check it and then she said we were good to go.",negative
28,I flew from Prestwick to Arrecife on 20/11/2020. Ground staff very friendly and helpful. The cabin crew were excellent. Really efficient providing a fantastic onboard service all with a smile and couldn't do enough.,positive
29,"Well, when a client asks for a glass of water to take his medicine and you say ""no""...say no more. Customer service on the web - also from the worst I have ever seen! Didn't help at all, and didn't try to even look like they are trying to! And advertising 5 euros flights to end up with 100 per a lousy destination. Overall - Abysmal experience! Starting from the ticket purchase straight to the flight to Paphos and back home. And the charging money for almost every step the client takes, really no words left.",negative
30,"They are fraudsters. Don’t let their stated prices misguide you: they will charge you at least 3x or 4x the amount. And not only because they don’t mention numerous additional fees, which alone cost much more than the stated ticket price. They will also try to charge you for services that you did not buy. I really cannot understand, what kind of a company can have a single priority: to cheat on their customers, to fool and deceive them. But that’s Ryanair! The feeling of being a victim of an air company’s fraudulent manipulations is awful, it’s like when someone steals your wallet. So, my advice - don’t let such things spoil your journey and choose a more honest and decent company instead. Also, the staff were very rude and unprofessional, but comparing to financial fraud they practice, it does not seem that big.",negative
32," I was quite apprehensive about booking with Ryanair having read many poor reviews, so, I read and reread the booking site until I understood what was required. The booking process was simple and easy to follow and I completed it without problems. There was a flight time change which was notified by email. On the days of travel both flights were on time, both staffed by pleasant and efficient cabin crew. The cabin was clean and Covid rules were followed. The seats were OK for short haul flights but hard. We used neither catering or duty free purchasing.We had an enjoyable experience and have no complaints. We will certainly do it again.",positive
33,"As I was unable to do an online check-in because of the mistake at their end, the website was not sending one time code for verification. They charged us 55 euros per ticket for check in at the check in counter and when asked about their mistake they said it does not matter if our website was not able to send you a code., we can not do anything about it. This is just a way to rob common people even if the mistake was at their end.",negative
34,"There were 2 flights one after the other (as I discovered later) at the same gate in a far corridor without speakers. I was at the gate one hour before a few meters from the desk, in the photo you can see how close I was. I had other people around me waiting for the next flight so I was not aware the gate closed. My name was automatically called in the airport but not in that corridor and the very unfriendly employee didn't say a word like ""the gate is closing any other passenger?"", not a word. When I got aware he simply repeated ""the gate is closed"" without neither watching me in the face or answering to any further question.",negative
35,"I have been forced to pay an extra of 45(ish)€ at the gate for the same hand luggage that I brought for free 4 days ago. All the staff at the gate were stating that I had no right to bring a hand luggage with me, and they kept denying it even though I showed them that on Ryanair's website it is written that 1 hand luggage is always included. Not recommended all, I will never take a Ryanair flight anymore.",negative
36," In a covid world the cabin was disgusting, it does not look like things have been cleaned enough or to a good enough standard. As soon as we got to our seats there were marks and when opening the food tray it was absolutely disgusting with splash marks all over it.",negative
37,"Our flight from Crete to Athens started off with online check-in issues. We followed the prompts, but there was no option for check in, only to cancel or change flight. We even watched a video but never was presented with a check in option on the mobile website. When we arrived at the airport, we spoke to one of the employees at the bag check line, and explained to her our issue with online check in. She offered no help or advice, only said there is nothing for her to do and that we must pay €55 each to print our tickets or we could speak to her coworker at a Skyserv help desk. We proceeded to the alternate employee at the Skyserv booth and once again explained our troubles with online check in. We even showed her the step by step process in which we tried to check in on our mobile phone. She started to raise her voice and said “I don’t know why you’re the only people having an issue. Other customers don’t have this issue. It’s clearly something you did wrong!” Instead of providing us with actual help and presenting a fix to the issue that we physically showed her on the phone, she was dismissive, blaming us, and outright rude. When we wished to escalate the matter, she refused to tell us her name and began acting even more erratic. She stated that “Ryanair will know who I am and I don’t have to give you any information.” At this point we were forced into making one of two decisions - miss our flight or pay €55 for each boarding pass. Extremely unsatisfied with the lack of help, we returned to the bag check desk, and decided to go ahead with the payment. At our second interaction with the bag check staff, we were informed that the price per boarding pass is now €62.50! We showed them the Ryanair email that said it was €55 and explained to said staff that she told us ten minutes prior that it was a €55 fee. The employee told us to look at her screen if we have an issue, because that’s what it says and she could give no explanation for the discrepancy in Ryanair email or what we were previously told. At this point we were uncomfortably coerced into choosing to either miss our flight or pay this new arbitrary price that no employee could give an explanation for. No one can explain to us why we were unable to check in online and no one can explain to us why there was an increase in price after this entire debacle. Fast forward two months after this incident and multiple complaints to Ryanair, they finally responded with again no resolution. A representative from Ryanair emailed stating, ""At first, I would like to express our sympathy regarding the circumstances resulting in you being unable to have done the check-in online. However, if a customer does not manage to check-in online then an airport check-in fee of €55/£55 per person is applied."" This acknowledges our inability to check-in, but somehow still place the blame on the customer. When questioned about why we were arbitrary told to pay €62.50 by the bag check staff when Ryanair and this representative's email clearly stated €55, another rep responded back with, ""Unfortunately, as per the previous responses you have received, our standpoint remains unaltered that means according to our agreed Terms and Conditions Article 10.1 all monies paid towards Ryanair are non-refundable."" So again no explanation. It really feels like a ""you have to pay whatever amount we tell you or you get to miss your flight"" situation. Ryanair is all about customers' dollars but not customer service!",negative
38,"Arrived at the gate in good time at stansted and the crew at the gate told me off for arriving when they had only just called final boarding. Told my husband they were lucky they were letting him on the flight. The flight was ok out, until one of the crew shouted at the man next to me whose small washbag had broken and was trying not to drop things out of it as he was putting it in the overhead locker. Arrived with all documentation, getting my PLF form sorted to show the gate on my phone and was asked if I’d had a Covid test (this was Italy now trying to return) all paperwork complete and was told not to bother showing my PLF as needed a Covid test and wasn’t allowed to board. We are fully vaccinated and have our day 2 tests ordered. Still refused boarding, despite saying we didn’t need them but he wouldn’t/couldn’t speak English. Took a taxi (€60) to get a test (€30) & bought tickets @ €270. We don’t need a Covid test, should have been allowed on our flight and as Ciampino airport closes overnight we are being made to sleep in the street. Well done Ryanair, great customer service and care for customers yet again. I am standing outside the airport now can hoping for a dry night as this will be where I will be.",negative
41,"First time travelling since pre COVID and thought I could check in at the desk with my bag. I was fined £55. No complaints but it would have been good to get a warning via email, also the employee checking me in at Bristol was incredibly rude and aggressive, no pls or thanks when taking my cash. Return leg I had already paid £70 for a checked bag booked via skyscanner. On the way back, the app was trying to charge me for a bag as I checked in. When I got to the airport, I was informed that I was to be charged €60 to check the bag in. Both staff dealt with were incredibly rude, offered no apologies and said it wasn’t their problem as I had booked on a third party website. When I complained that I had already paid for my bag, they threatened to cancel my flight. Zero customer service, £130 paid for a bag; and why do Ryanair use Skyscanner and other websites if you should only book on their website as their employees told me at Knock?",negative
43,"Ryanair does not have any respect for the customers and are just a money seeking airline. They do not see the mistakes of their own, but of the customers only. From check-in to security check up until getting on the flight it was full of chaos. Although we had plenty of time left, we had to be in a hurry but at the end we, us ourselves, found out that the plane was delayed. They did not make a single announcement about the delay, or sorry for the inconvenience. All they did was sit and do nothing. Thanks for ruining my trip to London. They charge you 3 euros for a bottle of water. Due to the run I had to make to the gate, because they had their problem, I needed water, but no! It's Ryanair, they will charge you for every single penny. I hope they fix their problems for other future customers.",negative
44,"I did a COVID test in Italy, they gave me the result in Italian, as I was in Italy I couldn’t imagine that the result had to be in English too, on boarding they didn’t me allow to get to the plane and told me to talk with their staff at check in and to do another test at the pharmacy. I spoke with them and they told me I had to pay 200 euros to fly in another flight because my flight had 30 min to departure. The worst airline in the UK. I had a test that was not in in English but anyone can read that it was negative, what’s the difficulty for an Italian born to read it?",negative
45," Coming back from Corfu was a nightmare. I am not moaning about our flight being cancelled because that may have been out of Ryanair's hands but the fact that they did not help with anything after we were told that the flight was cancelled is unbelievable! We were told to book our own flights and find accommodation. We were offered no care packages which are promised if your flight was delayed, in fact we were offered no help at all. We tried all night to talk to Ryanair through their app which was a total waste of time because we were never connected. We didn't have any children with us but many people did and their accommodation and flights must of been astronomical to rebook. I can not believe how they just dismissed us from their minds. I will think twice before using them again and I will definitely not recommend them to anyone",negative
46,"Worst airline ever, I have travelled with this airline several times and what applies to a city doesn’t apply to another. It’s supposed to be considered a low cost airline but they look for every possible way to charge you, I had no trouble getting my suitcase on the flight in Madrid airport but they made me pay for it the Canary Islands, I arrived 2 minutes late for boarding today’s flight (28 minutes still for take off), a lady was just in front of me, they let her pass and didn’t let me, said they had already closed. 2 ladies stated that all flights close their doors 30 minutes before departure when we all know that’s a lie. They start boarding 30 minutes before departure. They were very rude and should not work in customer service, it is not meant for everyone.",negative

48,I hadn't been travelling for 2 years since covid. I used to travel a lot but always was flight 'sick'! I hate take-offs and landings and I think that the best take-offs I had in years was on my flight to London! It was smooth and neat! Pilots don't often get to be congratulated on their skills but I do believe that it takes a lot to ensure that the experience on the flight is seamless even with a couple of turbulences! So congrats to the crew for making me want to travel again despite my fears!,positive
49,"Delays may happens but behavior of Ryanair is not customer oriented. With 3 hours of delay they sent voucher for just 4 euro meal, available only in cafes outside the departure area. And the delay of the departure is declared 2 h and 55 minutes in order not to pay compensation as per EU rules that starts with 3 hours delay.",negative
50,"After you book your ticket its almost impossible to get Customer service. We called directly to a number in Germany a few times and got somebody a couple of times. On our outbound flight, they rebooked us on United because our original flights had some delays. But when we arrived at the airport, United has no record of our reservation and try as they might they can't reach Lufthansa either at 4pm in the afternoon. We got a flight later in the evening causing a Munich stopover instead of the original Frankfurt and then to Amsterdam. The experience was bad.  On our return from Amsterdam, it was a code share with Swiss Air through Zurich. That flight was overbooked and they told us we won't have seats. Swiss Air were equally unhelpful. We finally got onto KLM hours later, however there was no Lufthansa person to be found at the Airport or by Phone to help with this.",negative
51,"Booked an economy light fare which only included a very small 8kg carry on bag. I found it strange that a full service airline would even have that option but given the fare was not cheap I assumed service on board would make up for this. Boarding was slow and messy requiring passengers to queue to have their documents checked, then queue again to check our tickets, then queue again in the jet bridge. What is the point of assigning boarding groups when all but priority passengers are called to board at the same time? Seats in economy were akin to a budget airline with minimal legroom, no headrest or entertainment. Cabin was not clean, and crew handed out alcohol wipes. On both legs I took with Lufthansa there was no food or drink available, complimentary or paid. This was a 2 hour service right about lunchtime. Almost any other full service airline would have provided some sort of food service. It is already low cost carrier like to only have paid food services. To have no service at all is just pathetic for a 5 Star Airline. Crew were barely seen during the flight. To top it off the flight was delayed. Overall the flight was worse than ultra low cost carriers while charging more.",negative
52,The carry on limit of 8kg is insane when your baggage size meet carry on standard dimensions. I flew million miles with this bag without any issue but getting your bag registered at the gate because it’s exceed 8kg while small overhaul size is not convenient. No drink on board except water because of COVID measure that can be understandable in present context…,negative
53,"I bought a flight with Lufthansa choosing a seat at the front due to my left ankle being fractured, so I needed the additional time to make it between gates. The day of they bump me from 4C to 29C, no one at the Lufthansa counter even 40 minutes before scheduled boarding so I call their helpline. The person eventually sees what they did, and says they'll reinstate my seat. They said they were sending the email right then. I get off the call and surprise surprise no email and when I check online my seat assignment is still at the back of the plane. Eventually ten minutes before boarding two crew members are at the desk, I ask about the situation, they tell me there is one seat available but that ""it's impossible to move you"" even though the seat is 5D. Same class same price. How could this have been worse you might ask? The flight ended up being delayed outbound too so the short time I had got cut in half.",negative
54,"Frankfurt to Amman. The phone service is very bad, you can not get anyone answering the phone to adjust your ticket nor to add your pet to the ticket. The seats are not that comfortable compared to other airlines and the most important thing is that you do not get any food, drinks or beverages on Lufthansa flights which is unacceptable hence you pay a good amount of money for no service where other cheaper airlines are providing beverage services and even other services like entertainment tv, etc!",negative
56,"The worst flight I have taken in my 50 years of travel. The Crew were abrasive and disengaging, clearly service was not a priority. If you asked a question you received a surly blunt response. The aircraft was  extremely uncomfortable and offered old in-flight entertainment. The headsets we received needed to be manipulated to accommodate this older system. The food provided was pathetic - macaroni and cheese for Economy class.  It turned out to be overcooked white pasta with processed Parmesan cheese thrown in for good measure. The salad was at least real. The breakfast was a sugar cake muffin with three small pieces of pineapple chunks. When I asked if I had received the meal as perhaps this was for children, I was told no that was the economy class meal. I will not fly Lufthansa again and have gone out of my way to tell many of my colleagues family and friends about this horrendous experience.",negative
57,"Worst travel experience of my entire life. Flight delayed from London meant 80 people missed the connection from Germany to Cape Town. Instead of holding the flight 30 minutes, Lufthansa let 80 people miss it. I was stranded in Germany for the night and then sent to Istanbul and then to Cape Town. What should have been a 12 hour trip took 48 hours and I was one of the lucky people, others on my flight with young families were having less luck and sent on even longer journeys with layovers of 12+ house. My flight back has now also been delayed by 14 hours.",negative
58,Messy online checkin in Bogota which didn't allow to upload my vaccination certificate (it did on the outbound route) nor select/change seat. I was able though to change my seat after downloading the LH mobile app. The vaccination cert was requested / checked by 3 different staff at bag dropoff and boarding. Horrible food served  with overcooked vegetarian pasta served for mains on both outbound and inbound flights. IFE was mediocre with a very poor selection of films. The staff were brusque. Seat comfort poor. Used LH pre pandemic and the experience was much better.,negative
60,"A very mediocre experience. For a 13 hours flight, they provided passengers with a hot meal and a snack. The plane was dirty, my entertainment system worked once in a while.

62,"Our flight had to make an emergency landing due to an unwell passenger which was understandable however what happened next made me never want to fly with Lufthansa again. Pilot said we could either rebook onto another flight or stay in a hotel while another flight is arranged for us. Upon departing the plane we were approached by a member of staff of Ankara airport who had no ties to Lufthansa. She provided a phone number to get in contact with Lufthansa should we want to rearrange a flight, this number did not work. After calling multiple Lufthansa numbers we were told different lies on every attempt as to why they couldn't rebook us onto a flight leaving in 2 hours. The best one was that our baggage hadn't been released by the airport when we in fact had the baggage in our hands. On 2 occasions the member of staff  we were speaking to just stopped replying to any questions or queries and seemed to have hung up. This all resulted in a substantial phone bill and a missed days work. After contacting them to offer the opportunity to reimburse the said phone bill as a good will gesture and reinvest some faith in this airline I was accused of demanding compensation.",negative

No other information given. Was told I would not make the MUC to BOS flight so they canceled my whole itinerary and re-booked my travel to the next day. Was given hotel and meal voucher. Next day, departed KRK 20 minutes late and arrived MUC 20 minutes late. Only had an hour to transfer between terminal 2 and remote terminal in MUC. Ridiculous security screening just to get to the departure gate. My bags were searched 3 times at 3 check points. Woman in front of me made the flight. I got there 5 minutes later and they had closed the doors and refused to allow me on. I am sitting here in MUC as I write this looking at my plane still sitting at the departure gate nearly an hour after the scheduled departure time and I am furious. No excuse to strand me in MUC especially since the plane is departing late anyways.",negative

We understand planes are moving parts that do fail, but the lack of communication and NO communication from Lufthansa is inexcusable as well as not adhering to the EU passenger rights. After having been in airplanes for over 50 hours trying to get home and Lufthansa was no help. Then Lufthansa lost my bag and when received they had rifled through my belongings and didn't put things back. The rudeness of the Stewardess was like nothing I had ever experienced - they were arrogant, condescending and borderline vile.",negative

69," Horrible Customer Service. The country i was flying to had closed its borders because of rising covid cases, and no tourist would be allowed to enter. Naturally, I had to cancel my flight and ask for a refund. When i called them when I saw that I was not refunded a few months later, they started by saying that it is my fault and people should stop trying to blame them for the cancelled flights since they chose the lower tier ticket. Even when I explained to her, that I was not even allowed to enter the country even if i wanted to take the flight, she kept saying it is my fault for doing that and not reading the fine prints. Needless to say, i always prefer to pay extra and know that my ticket is refundable, but in this case the non-refundable fine print was really fine I guess. Horrible customer service, and always ready to point fingers even during a pandemic. I would never fly with them ever again. Horrible experience.",negative

One shift staff deny you to board, but in the same situation the other shift staff let you board.

Stay night in Frankfurt- can't give us details on if they can book us but to show up at 7 the next morning. Two groups split half go to Porto other half Frankfurt to Munich then to Porto - Wait in airport till 8PM, flight cancelled. -Wait in a line for a few hours just to be taken to a hotel and to come back the next day - Booked for Thursday morning but messed up an individuals to the point that he can't do anything on the app. We are told to come back at 8 PM on Thursday for the flight After chatting with them we find out the bikes made it to Porto except 1.  Get call at 3:55 AM saying we missed our flight, they changed without notice so two of our members go to the airport. We chat that morning and are about to go to the airport to figure it out when the front desk lady of the hotel says that we need to be out by 1 as taxis are coming.  Go to airport for flight find out they didn’t transfer our bike reservation to it and they can’t fit them now. Individual chats with them for 4 hours. Gets us finally on a larger flight that will take our bags. Charged $60 extra dollars per bike We spent 7 days in airports and airplanes out of 11. In the first 5 days we had 12 hours not in an airport or plane because of everything. We tried to make the best of the weather delays and enjoy the city we got stuck in.

Same on return leg apart from wrap swapped for hard cheese roll. A lot of people complaining.

The lady who cleans the shower booth yelled at me for not having waited standby near the shower booth when the shower was ready.

So on 27.12.2021, I flew from Vienna to Frankfurt, and then Frankfurt to Malta where Lufthansa has lost my baggage. The lack of communication from Lufthansa and the lack of service that has followed ever since is beyond belief. I received a message as soon as I landed in Malta on 27.01.2021 that my suitcase had not been loaded on the flight. I checked with Lufthansa at the airport right away and filled the correct report – I was instructed to do nothing more and to call Malta Airport and check the next day and arrange for delivery. The luggage has still not arrived and it is 2 weeks later 09.01.2022. From what I was told by the Lufthansa desk in Malta they tried to communicate and investigate with Vienna with no response. From what I can see on the Lufthansa tracking on their site the baggage was sent on 28.12.2021 from Vienna to Malta, and then for some unknown reason from Malta to Frankfurt - however, Malta Airport is reporting the luggage never even landed in Malta. Since then I have had to contact Lufthansa who claims there is no report even made, I have called Frankfurt Airport, Vienna Airport, and Copenhagen Airport to try and get some assistance, I have been passed around and have to communicate with Central Baggage Services and World Tracker – this is beyond infuriating and also just simply unfair as Lufthansa should be able to at the very least guide me in what to do and see where the error happened.",negative

I was instructed to cancel my flights and rebook them and call customer service back with the new reservation codes to get my seats reassigned without repaying for seat assignments. I did that and called back. Again, I was on hold for hours. I gave the new customer service rep my old and new reservation numbers and she was able to transfer my seat assignments but then I realized I did not get any money back for my canceled flights. Even though they say you can exchange the tickets. You can’t if you cancel. And that’s what they told me to do. After fighting they gave me my money back.

First I tried 6 times, the computer hung up on my every time, then I tried it very early in the morning on the next time and I had to wait for 35 minutes until someone picked up.  The woman was not very friendly, I told her my story and she gave me a new flight and muted herself for around 5 minutes without letting me know.

Every time I suggested a flight or date I could exchange my ticket for they told me I could not do it. There is no customer service, no one to speak to or even email, and once they have your money you are hung out to dry. Hence they have taken £612 for a flight that is worth £300 due to the fact that they will not not honour their no fee change policy.

The flight was not great, but not terrible, my seat had very little legroom but I’d just come if a Qatar Airways business class flight so maybe that clouded my judgement a little. Anyway they didn’t bother to put my bag on the aircraft. It wasn’t lost, they knew exactly where it was, in their home airport they could find someone to put it in the plane. Did they put it in the next flight, no. Did they put it in the next day?  Air France chose  not to send my bag today. They sent me an email saying they had the bag just after midnight so they had 10 hours to put it in AF1058 this morning. They didn’t do it. They chose to not send it.

They don't add the previous travel insurance to the new ticket. Air France sends an email that the flight is delayed a few days before and then at 1 am when the flight leaves at 6:10 am they send an SMS that is delayed another 40 minutes. Once on the plane, it was delayed another 40 minutes. No one explains why. Inside the plane, already arriving in Paris, it is going to land and a few seconds before this, it takes off again. Why? Nobody tells us anything. It gives me an anxiety attack not knowing what's going on, all the delays we had with this airline and the. Concern that I won't get to catch the other link and I get up to ask. I am dragged by the steward by the arm through the plane to my seat. Disrespecting me and making me and those around me even more nervous because we really believed that something very, very serious was happening since the stewardess' reaction was very abrupt. After arriving in Paris I had to run to catch the next flight to Cork. I arrive in Cork and they have lost my suitcase. I file the claim, they tell me that today I will have my suitcase, that they have sent it to cork because it must have stayed in Paris and still no one has called me, nor have I received my suitcase or anything.

All the luggage, catering etc. had to be transferred, and then we went back to the gate and boarded the replacement aircraft. AF emailed me explaining my EU rights to file a claim.  After four months of processing, they denied the claim saying, I arrived to CDG from a non-EU airport. AF took over four months to process this claim. The reason thy gave was, they were busy. I got no compensation, and we were not offered any refreshments on the day.  I'm not flying AF again.",negative

The last customer service person said that my suitcase is on the way and it should arrive on March 10 at 1pm, I called at 5 pm he said its in Logan airport and it will be delivered to me tomorrow.

112,"The A350 plane is great for passengers (comfortable and quiet). However, the service in Mumbai is sub-par at best and the service on board was not good. I was unable to check-in via their website - they weighed my bags at the check-in counter in Mumbai and they weighed by back pack and my carry on. I had 8kg more than their limit and they asked to me to either pay $200 to check it in or remove excess weight. I removed the excess weight but was still 3kgs over. I asked if I could pay for the extra (3KG) and she said we don't negotiate. The Ground Staff Manager was unwilling to even engage in conversation.  On board they served the first meal within 30 minutes but did not serve any alcohol. The Stewardess said they don't serve it because it's too early and not served with breakfast.  7 hrs and 30 minutes later they served lunch, nothing served in between. I asked for a beer and the stewardess said no.",negative

120,"My first flight was cancelled last minute, causing me to be rebooked on a second flight. While frustrating, this sometimes can't be helped, especially with COVID and the winter weather. However, my flights were cancelled a total of three times, costing me $450 in COVID test fees, as well as $300 in hotel costs to stay near the airport due to the last minute cancellations and rebookings. Very poor communication from staff to passengers about what was happening with flights - we were sat for over an hour after the initial departure time waiting to hear what was happening, only to be repeatedly told we would be boarding ""soon"", followed by the surprise news that our flight was cancelled. It's incredibly frustrating to have to relay the messages back to my manager back home, and pray the next flight I book won't be cancelled. I understand that the current global situation has placed pressured on airlines, and I wouldn't be leaving a bad review over one cancelled flight. But to be told the flights will ""definitely"" be going ahead, and to be cancelled again and again, is frustrating and unprofessional for everyone involved. It also seems that very few other flights are having this happen to them, and even when I've flown during other points of the pandemic, I've never faced such poor communication and repeated cancellations. Staff were polite, but misinformation was still given, and everything felt poorly organised and poorly communicated to the staff left to answer questions to the stranded passengers. Airport travel is stressful enough, even when everything goes as planned.",negative
121,"I booked with KLM which was a nightmare. I was supposed to fly Air France SG to Rome and with KLM from Rome to SG but I changed my flight. Since my booking was made with KLM, it was impossible to get a hold of anyone when my VTL flight was cancelled and I was reassigned a non VTL flight. Air France was very professional despite my upset state and rearranged everything for me, and both my flights during this trip was extremely pleasant. The crew was very nice and helpful. I would next time just book directly with Air France. I would like to add that ground staff at CDG did a great job too. Thank you Air France!",positive
122,I booked my trip 2 months in advance. This airline canceled my flight in August 2021 the day before departure with no notification (I had received my confirmations and itinerary emails reliably so if something would have been sent I would have seen it. I also checked Spam and all the Promotions and Social folders in desperation). I only found out when I tried to check in online at 5pm the day before and saw it was canceled. I tried multiple times to reach the airline for help and the line hung up automatically after playing a message about the wait time. I would have gladly waited to speak with anyone. Multiple online searches with this airline showed no other flights available to my destination so I had to book a new reservation with a different carrier at more than double the cost ($1400 vs my original $600!). I did receive a full refund of my original purchase price but the airline would not take responsibility for the fact that their poor communication forced me to spend double+ on this trip than was budgeted and it was not possible to cancel and reschedule this trip.,negative
125," Short flight on a brand new two and a half week old airplane. Air France delivered great service as expected. Check in at Charles de Gaulle was quick and friendly, but the terminal was pretty full once we got to security. Boarding was very fast on this full flight. I ended up falling asleep so didn’t get a snack but when I woke up I was offered two bottle of wine by the crew. Upon landing in Madrid I was able to take a picture of the cockpit. Very nice plane with a brand new smell and friendly crew. ",positive

Check in was a breeze since the flight was only had full, once we boarded they’re was a blanket, pillow and headphones on each seat. Most passengers had their own row, which was great since it was an overnight flight and sleep was needed. Service onboard was fantastic, tasty dinner with champagne and wine, snacks in the back for mid flight and prior to landing a small baggie with a quick breakfast was offered. Inflight entertainment had a very good choice of movies and music to pass the time along.",positive

They cancelled my flight which is understandable, but when I tried to contact their customer service line, I waited for over 45mins on the line without an answer 3 times within 2 days. Finally, on the final attempt, my call was answered at 51mins waiting time. I was relieved, finally, I could speak to a human being and ask for help to my situation. The customer service rep literally said, ""sorry there is nothing we can do, good bye"" and preceded to hang up on me.",negative
130,"My experience was very horrible. First they cancelled my flight on the morning I was going to fly. They put me on an alternate flight and when I arrived on the airport, it was a huge mess. The flight was delayed by almost two hours and for that reason I missed my connecting flight from Paris. I had to wait in Paris airport for six hours which caused me to miss my train from Milan to Rome and I did not get a refund for that booking. The air hostesses on the flights were very rude and unhelpful. When I was returning back from Milan to Paris I had requested assistance which unfortunately did not arrive at all at Paris airport. I was made to wait for a very long time and yet the assistance did not arrive. I had to walk by myself to the other terminal to get the connection and had to walk very fast as my time was wasted waiting for the assistance. When I entered the flight the attendants were very rude and did not help me put the luggage away in spite of requesting it. I was asked to do it by myself as they said that they will not do it at all. Again in London I did not receive any assistance and the flight was delayed by one hour they did not seem to care for any travelers who had connecting flights. No one was informed where are flights connection will be from. I had to run like crazy to catch the flight. I was given the wrong gate number when asked by one of the Air France representative. I barely made it to the flight and then I entered the Virgin Atlantic flight to San Francisco which was operated by Air France. I was told that there are only 10 blankets for the entire flight and I will not be able to avail the facility of the blanket. The headphones were broken and unusable. I will never recommend ever to anyone to use Air France and I will not use it either. I need my money which got wasted on cancellation of train.",negative

133,"I was booked onto a flight with only a 45 minute layover which is already difficult. The flight from Tunis was delayed which meant I had to sprint to my next flight. I had asked the crew on board if they could call ahead to tell the plane I was coming and they said no - I had time to make the connection (by the time the flight arrived I had 25 mins). I had to go through security again - a horrible woman put my bag through extra screening just because I told her I was in a rush and when I got to my gate (miraculously 10mins before the scheduled departure time) they told me the flight had already left. It was the last flight of the day out to Geneva meaning I had to spend the night at an Ibis in Paris, wake up at the crack of dawn to make the first flight out in the morning and still had to take an additional day out of my annual leave to compensate for Air France staff utter uselessness! Not once in this whole process did anyone try and help me, no one even apologized! The worst flight experience I have ever had. PS - whilst this particular leg was awful, every single other leg of this journey, including both flights outbound to Tunis were delayed as well. Definitely will never be flying with Air France again.",negative

I booked a ticket (Miami to Paris via Madrid and Paris to Miami via Madrid) for my daughter through Air Europa. The Paris to Madrid flight was subcontracted to Air France. My daughter went to Air France, dropped her luggage and presented her travel documents. The agent checked these documents and gave her the boarding pass attached with a green dot to clear her. Well, once in Madrid and right before embarking to Miami, she was refused access to the plane because she did not have a negative PCR. How can an Air France agent let her board a plane for the USA without checking or asking about the PCR test and still clear her to board a plane. I have been trying to reach someone at Air France and file a complaint but because my booking is with Air Europa I cannot do so. I filed a complaint with Air Europa and of course am ignored. I texted many employees from corporate with Air France and each time asked to contact Air Europa. This is disrespectful and unprofessional because Air France should be aware of the wrong doing of their employees and make sure this mistake does not happen again.",negative

No agents available to answer questions or assist withe kiosks etc. No separate check in for business class and most checkin done by passengers after they figured out how to print bag tags and load bags on belt. The service in business was unbelievable. We were on board 1.5 hours with a posted ATC delay and waiting for late passengers. No preflight service offered. After departure, only given drinks during lunch service. I had to go to attendants station to request a wine refill, but it never showed for my wife or self. Finally, after ringing on service button, mine showed, but not wife's. For two meals, I was served two pasta dishes. I've had better service in Coach. Bottom line, we will never again fly AF.",negative
141,"My biggest complaint is that they only provided a 10 minute window for boarding. There was a last minute gate change. I’m sure that they announced the gate change because there were announcements in both German and French.  I missed out on the information about the last minute gate change. When I noticed that the next flight was going to Morocco, I knew something was wrong so I looked at the departures and rushed to the correct gate. When I got there, the doors were already closed. They rebooked me into a middle seat in regular economy. My original booking was premium economy. They claimed that there were no seats available in premium economy but I saw that there were. I had to pay for my own hotel room because the next flight available was for the next day. I complained to the airline and they basically said how unfortunate it must be to be me. They won’t do anything.",negative

I really recommend Air France for travel.",positive
143, Air France is providing zero service in Business Class on flights between the UK and France. I flew Manchester to Paris and was offered nothing. Not even water. The crew disappeared to the back of the aircraft and closed the curtain for the entire flight.

What a joke.,negative
144,"Great all round experience once in the air. On the ground is a different story! The good experience was really down to a fabulous crew. Very professional and charming. The food & beverages was really good. It seems like out of CDG the on board experience has really picked up since I last flew AF out of CDG just prior to covid. Great selections and quality along with awesome presentation. The 787 is really great for long haul. Good seats, good entertainment, quiet cabin and good amenities. Arrived in DTW approx 45 mins ahead of schedule. The bad part is the ground service. I'm sure the rush to travel now restrictions are being eased does not help, but at both LIS and CDG the boarding process is pandemonium. No-one seems to understand zoned boarding, so you literally have to fight your way through throngs of people to board at your allotted time. The paperwork for Covid related info at CDG was never addressed over the PA, but there was a table (without pens) and some papers that should be filled out, but no-one working the gate said anything until you were scanning your BP with the gate agent, so many people would then retreat back to the table and back through the line of passengers waiting to board. To cap all this, a PAX traveling with her 7 YO son was denied boarding and caused a major commotion for about 20 mins as she had been misinformed about her sons test. OK maybe this isn't on Air France, but from what she screamed to the security agents would suggest she had been given the wrong info by Air France the previous day when she was denied boarding because she didn't have the correct test to travel to USA. After getting the required test she arrived at the gate of my flight only to be denied because her son had not been tested. I know this is 100% on the passenger, but she had been misinformed about this requirement by AF the previous day in regards to her son, so certainly have some sympathy for her. Overall it added enormously to the chaos and CDG is not best equipped to have an entire widebody's load of PAX jostling and not observing any kind of distancing. Apart from the poor ground service the only negative thing while in the air was the terrible wifi. Such slow speeds even emailing was futile and considering I paid to be connected the entire flight, I couldn't really work on anything.",positive

148,"Our flight was delayed for 2 hours, wish I could cope with thought. But after that it went from bad to worse. They firstly announced that they forgot a part of the luggage in Paris, so we had to wait till the next flight to receive them.  Every day we hoped for some good news, but we ended up spending our 3 week trip without our cloths and presents we got for our family over there. When the flight back also got delayed 35 mins I was disappointed. Luckily the air attendants were kind during the flight, otherwise it would have been a total nightmare.

Since, I had no more boarding pass, I couldn't go upstairs and was with my daughter .. no food and no change in currency. They wanted my daughter and I to sleep there, they didn't even have plugs for our phones. I didn't have food or anything and my daughter was tired and hungry. I became irritated and wanted to call the U.S embassy since I am in the military. The lady then negotiated for me and I got a choice, to take the ticket back to the US.

153,"I missed my flight due to a confusion with the flights in the airport (Moscow SVO) - when two flights of Aeroflot were scheduled to the same destination with a difference of approx. 20 minutes, but one of them was not shown on the departure board (for some unknown reason). As a result I missed my flight arriving 5 minutes late to my gate. Other passengers were at the gate before me and still were not allowed to the flight. When I approached the customer desk in Moscow with my issue of a missed flight I still had three more connecting flights left in my round trip ticket. They informed me that the whole ticket was cancelled. It took them months to respond after and no support was provided with regard to my cancelled flights. How about the so called bonus miles program? Apparently it's not even possible to spend them in any way if you haven't reached 3000 miles. So, some of my flights with Aeroflot were not even counted in the miles account even though I travel quite often. Is there a bug not counting the miles even when you enter the frequent flyer number?",negative

As tickets for alternative flights were being bought by other people and prices were rising very quickly, the only realistic option was to buy a new ticket from Aeroflot for a date before the closure of borders, and then claim a refund. The price of this new ticket was several times more expensive than the original ticket. Aeroflot have refused to provide a refund for the new ticket.

So I’ve decided to do my voucher and the website didn’t work. So I’ve sand email to the center again nd this afternoon I’ve tried the voucher with my friend name and she got her voucher back but you can only use 15% on it so how many flight I need to do to have my £800 back?. And with my name I can’t have my voucher I don’t know why for my ticket that put error.  I’ve been fighting during almost 10 months to have my refund.

164,"My flight was cancelled by Aeroflot back in April. We called multiple times throughout April, May and June and I was promised a refund of the full amount. It was obviously not up to me whether to take that flight or not and it is reasonable to expect a full refund. However refund was never provided. I tried to send multiple messages to the airline’s customer service as well with no response. Last week I tried to call Aeroflot customer service. I had to pay for the international call as there are no representatives in Australia where I live. The customer service was extremely poor. To be honest, I have not encountered such poor attitude in years and it was extremely frustrating. The customer service representative could not properly address any of the issues. She said that the only two options are a voucher and reissuing new ticket. Well, I don’t live in Russia or even Europe so there is absolutely no way I can use these options. The reason why I bought a ticket with Aeroflot was that the transfer time was convenient on my way from Rome to Tokyo, I was not even intending to visit Russia. I explained it and no, nothing she was willing to do, just continued quoting new Russian legislation that came into effect half a year after I bought the ticket! I asked to explain how come I was promised a refund previously and was held waiting for months and months and now it’s not an option. She couldn’t explain. She said I can submit complain through the feedback section. I explained that I have tried to communicate the issue through the feedback section already and not getting any response. She said she can’t help with. Then I asked her to connect me to her supervisor and no, she couldn’t do it for some reason. This is the first time ever I couldn’t speak to a customer service manager or a supervisor. Basically the company just decided to keep my money that I paid, go ahead with it and customer service did not care at all. I just lost a lot of money on the international call without any resolution. This situation is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Every other airline I booked with that cancelled flights provided me a refund a while ago, despite COVID-19. Understand there are struggles at the moment and I did accept a voucher from an Australian airline because I can use it living in Australia. But I just can't use an Aeroflot voucher. The ticket wasn’t a cheap ticket either and it was refundable and it is outrageous that I can’t get money back for a ticket that was refundable (and I paid a premium for it to be refundable and have an option to receive a refund). I sent another message to the airline following the call and received the same response about vouchers that is pretty much just their copy paste from the customer service templates. The airline does not care about their customers and reputation and is just exploiting COVID-19 situation to hold customers’ cash for as long as possible (if not indefinite).",negative

Staff were amazing, food was good (although I think Aeroflot still has a room for improvement here, especially if it wants to become a 5 star airline), and ground service was quick and efficient.

I will end up spending more money and time trying to solve this than the money spent on my ticket. They do not provide any solution, neither seem to care, they do not answer my emails.

To date unable to get my refund despite numerous calls to Aeroflot call center. All they are trying to do is offer me to use a voucher despite my ticket fare being subject to a full refund. No timeframe given as to when the refund will be processed. In addition my upgrade miles are also not processed and returned to my account yet. Aeroflot has strict rules when you are buying and paying but they seem not liable to follow any binding rules with regards to refunds.,negative

176,New York to Tel Aviv via Moscow. I paid $150 for upgrading from the Economy to premium economy. The flight was full and there was no place in premium economy so they gave me a regular seat in Economy. I contacted the flight attendant to refund the money I paid for the upgrade and she referred me to a customer service I called customer service twice and mail them about what happened and they obviously ignored and said they don’t know what I am talking about. I have been waiting a year for a refund! I will never fly with them again!,negative

180,"Bucharest to Moscow. My first time ever with Aeroflot and thoroughly enjoyed it. I can honestly say some of the best cabin service I have received anywhere. Cabin staff were friendly and warm and accommodated all requests and did everything with confidence and style. All were also immaculately attired and turned out. For a three hour flight, not overly long, they got in three services, a food run, then tea and coffee and duty free and made it look easy. I also loved the Sukhoi Superjet (SSJ100) despite all the stories about it. I chose to fly it deliberately, as I wanted to see for myself what it was like. Great little regional commuter. I found it very comfortable inside with ample leg room and a rear toilet that was huge - larger than on some big wide bodies. Plane was also very clean inside. No IFE but to be expected on short haul regional commutes and didn't phase me and didn't expect any. So my overall experience with Aeroflot from Bucharest to Moscow return, was outstanding and enjoyable and I can't think of anything to mark down. I will be flying with them again and will try a longer haul on a different aircraft to see how it compares. Based on two flights though, I would recommend them highly.",positive
181,"Ljubljana to Moscow. Both flights on time. Cabin nice and fresh, seating much better than average in economy. To my surprise, Aeroflot introduced hot meals also for flights of less than 3 hours. Menu card for lunch with 2 options and in return for breakfast with 3, meals nice and tasty. Cabin crews pleasant and working hard. Overall, great flights. The only problem is that they do not send relevant information to passengers, e.g. 24 hours before departure the departure terminal in the mail from Aeroflot was F, which was wrong, the departure terminal was actually D, a very different one far away. Still, when it comes to economy product Aeroflot and Turkish stand out from the rest in Europe.",positive

They had no procedure of how to take care of passengers that missed their connection flight, and we were stuck at Moscow airport with two toddlers. My advise is simply to stay away.",negative

I told him I checked in from Amsterdam and all my hand luggage was fine, what can I do now, can I pay for this. He literally shouted ""You have 3 minutes to throw away your stuff now or you stay in Moscow tonight!"".  I had to throw away some of my clothes, bag of cosmetics,  book, notebook, bag of socks from my hand luggage and backpack.  Then they finally let me pass, I went on to the plane and waited until everybody has boarded to see the whole plane was at least 20% empty seated? Their staff cannot treat its client this.",negative

In my case, I had further connections to take and I reached the gate on time. Delays happen to every companies. However, Aeroflot did not offer to change the booking as such a delay may cause me to miss connections, and with an expiring visa, being trapped din Russia is the last thing I hope at the end of my holiday. No refreshments at the airport provided by Aeroflot, no information about the updated check-in time.  Not a single goodwill action. I won't travel by Aeroflot anymore.",negative

We paid 100 euro more to select seats, with this I hoped that I would be able to book the extra leg space, I would not even mind to pay again a bit extra, this was not possible, we called with the airline and asked if they could book them for us. This was not possible, we should do this at the airport 24 hours before check in, we went to the airport to arrange this, this was not possible, we should do this in Moskou. There we had 1.5 hour transfer time. Next day we checked in and we will fix the extra leg space in Moskou, when we arrived in Moskou we had to wait in a line, because of a delay we had 45 minutes transfer time. At the transfer desk we tried to get the extra legspace.  During the flight there were many rows with the extra legspace free. I was not allowed to change seats. For the way back we managed it differently, we went again 24 hours before to the airport... no aeroflot desk.. For this flight back we managed it.

Then 5 days before my flight, I got the message that my alternative flight was full and there was no other option then to cancel my booking with a refund. I was therefore forced to find an alternative flight myself within 5 days.  I did manage to find an alternative flight but it cost me way much more than what I originally booked.",negative
193,"✅ Trip Verified |  Warsaw to Moscow return. Standard in economy class is better than in LH, or LOT. We got a tasty sandwich, apple, and choco wafel. For drink, selection of juices, tea & coffee were served, in Moscow free newspapers and magazines. The aircraft was extremely clean. Flight attendants were very polite and helpful and very well organized however, the aircraft was near full. Ground service in Moscow is organized better than in e.g. CDG, or Lyon. In all airports you have to wait in the lines for passport control, it usually takes about 20 - 30 minutes, but in WAW was 20 also. From the airport is a very comfortable train to the center.",positive
194,"Paris to Phuket via Moscow, economy class, Dec 4th 2019. Frequent Flyer with Aeroflot for nearly 3 years now, all I can say is that I'm fully satisfied with them. Swift priority check-in and security check in Paris via dedicated lanes for Frequent Flyers. Lounge access. Fly Attendants very welcoming, helpful and genuine. Space + seat (front row) and economy seat with good width (18') and pitch (32') - Aeroflot is one of the very few Airlines to still give 18 inches width (most nowadays give 17"" or less). Moscow Airport is quite good, the various lounges for Frequent Flyers / business passengers are really excellent. Arrived on time and relaxed to Phuket. Had only once in 3 years a delayed luggage (was delivered 48 hours latter to my door in Paris, free of charge to me). Overall an excellent Airline and I strongly recommend Aeroflot.",positive
195,"Aeroflot has two faces. When things run smoothly, they are okay, but when you have a problem with them, they are a pure disaster. I flew with my family from Asia to Sweden, via Moscow. Even though we had more than an hour of waiting in Moscow none of our luggage arrived with us in Sweden. We reported it. Aeroflot was extremely unclear about where and when the luggage would come, and they were unable to locate it, until it, different days, arrived in Sweden. It then turned out that one of our hard Samsonite suitcases had a hole in it. It was too big to be acceptable and I therefore made a claim to Aeroflot, in accordance with their procedure. They answered me that I should send original documentation to Moscow. I did so, but was careful enough to make copies of everything. A couple of days later they just closed my claim, without any further explanations. After that I have contacted them a large number of times, making new claims referring to the original one and so forth. When they noticed that I did not give up, they tried a new strategy – to not answer. After months of waiting, I contacted them again, and actually got an answer: that they had increased their own handling time, according to the Russian law (they said), with another 30 days. Then it was silent again. Next time I contacted them they told me to make a new claim, since the first one was not treated! When I said I did not want to they referred to the Swedish Aeroflot office, which in turn told me to send the claim to them. But when the Swedish office answered to my claim it was with the information that they would not handle the case. Indeed, I have to communicate with the Moscow office, they told me. Aeroflot clearly have no intention whatsoever to give me any compensation. If you think that your suitcases and luggage is not so much to care for, you could buy a ticket with Aeroflot, but if you have any luggage that has a value you should think more than once - and then use another air flight company.",negative

198,"London to Seoul via Moscow. I was delayed due to the cyclone hitting South Korea at the time of the flight. However, the service and unfriendliness of the staff have left a bitter taste. We arrived at about 19:30. There was very little information provided. They were arranging a hotel to stay for the night, but could not announce that until 22:00. They then took the delayed passengers upstairs and left us there for a further hour with no information. They then collected us, but we then wait another hour until the coach finally came to take us to the hotel. Once at the hotel, they let us in, in small groups. We then had to be paired with strangers in one room, but that took forever. We finally made it into a hotel room at 02:00 with the flight scheduled for 05:55. They were arranging collection at 04:00, so with only 2 hours to rest, it was a terrible experience. The staff were apathetic toward all the passengers affected. They did not seem to care and just left us all confused and without information. The flights themselves were okay, but the staff were relatively unfriendly to me. I would not recommend Aeroflot. There are better long-haul carriers for a little extra money. Do yourself a favour and spend that little bit more for better comfort and service.",negative

200,"This has been the worst travel experience ever. It started with the call center confirming our seats the day before travel from the first section of the plane to the end of plane upon check in. We were told boarding was delayed for hours until they finally canceled the flight Los Angeles to Istanbul. We were told to go to the ticket counter for assistance. Needless to say herds of us headed that way only to encounter chaos. No one from Turkish airlines had a contingency plan or a way to establish order. The flight that was checking in was stopped as all employees vanished for a long time. The call center was of no help since they just said the flight is delayed when i am looking at the ticket counter and see the flight canceled info. We were told by an employee to form a line in one stop to be changed to another spot 20 minutes later. Then to be told to go collect baggage and return in order to be attended. Meanwhile there were other travelers who stayed and demanded help which they received (they were traveling to Tel Aviv). My husband and I went to collect baggage and came back to ticket counter. With the same story of form a line here and then there and then moving it yet again, all the meanwhile this group was being assisted the whole time while no one else had this treatment. We finally got tickets for the next flight to Istanbul. We were separated by half a plane for the 13 hour flight. While getting settled in I noticed the same group of people being very demanding to the flight attendants causing them to be unavailable for other passengers due to all their demands. The most turbulence ever on a flight. Upon arrival to Istanbul we encounter 2 flights held awaiting passengers from our flight however ours was not held (which was scheduled to leave even later than the Tel Aviv flight and Barcelona) Our connecting flight was for Belgrade. We were given the biggest runaround through the airport to try and get assistance for next flight to Belgrade and hotel accommodations. After hours we arrive at a hotel in downtown area where now it was midnight and nothing was open. Stranded without food, toiletries and clean clothes. We were picked up 3.5  hours later and dropped off at the airport. No one could help me from Turkish airlines in the Turkish airport!  Arriving to Serbia I called the call center from Serbia to be told my ticket numbers have changed and that is why can’t access my flights on the app or website any longer. Even with the new numbers still have the same problem. I could not select return flight seats over the phone or online. I was told i had to go to the main office in Belgrade. My husband is 6’6” and needs extra leg room. Not an option. I sent emails to complain about situation and try to receive help to only be told “we are sorry for inconveniences”. Needless to say I am in Belgrade to try and receive help at their office. Worse service ever! “Due to covid” no one in office can do anything other than ticket purchases. I am dreading the flights back home. I will encourage any and all people thinking about traveling with Turkish airlines to reconsider. It might be more money up front but it will be better in the long run. This has been a cloud over our whole trip. Not worth the lack of piece of mind and hassle.",negative
201,"I was denied flight back to Canada from Istanbul. I was stranded in the airport with no one helping me. I had to wait for the next flight which was 2 days later. This caused me extreme anxiety, stress and unnecessary extra costs to my trip. I believe Turkish Airlines should compensate me for time, money loss and for pain & suffering. They have very poor customer service online and on the phone. As well their customer service agents in the airport are very rude, and abrupt. They made derogatory comments to me in Turkish the customer service agents definitely do not help their customers. I made a complaint to the company and I’m still waiting for a response. Upon my arrival in Istanbul airport on Monday February 14th I immediately called Turkish Airlines for reservation for my cat. I was told (though the representative asked me of the breed and the size of my pet I provided) that the cabin had reached its capacity limit and that the only option I had was to put my cat in the holding cargo. The representative even told me that I must have a hard carrier for my cat since she’s going to be put in the cargo. She then reserved a spot for my cat and told me that I’d receive an email confirmation for the requests. I received two emails. First email was for the cabin and it was not confirmed due to full capacity but second email was confirmed for cargo. The representative did not tell me that my cat was not allowed in the cargo and went ahead with the reservation. Based on the confirmation I received from Turkish Airlines I proceeded with my flight as usual on February 16th. I was held for the entire duration of the check out at Turkish airport with many different excuses from several different agents and scenarios and no clear explanation why I couldn’t fly at that time. The first reason was that my cat couldn’t be in the cargo area because there was a large dog and then the other reason was that I didn’t have sufficient documents and then they said that Because of my cat’s breed (exotic shorthair) I hadn’t reserved for my cat far in advance. I was extremely stressed out and the frustration was unbearable and above all my cat was in a lot of distress and hunger and thirst and no where litter box for her toilet. The Turkish Airlines staff were extremely unprofessional, unhelpful, and rude with me. They all refused to provide me with their name.  I experienced the worst customer service from a big company that I once thought they were a decent airline to fly with. This whole issue started all internally within the airline and no one wanted to help out. I was told by customer relations to wait in the airport until management team calls me to provide me with hotel, transportation, and my next flight for free of charge because this was the airline error and not mine. I was in the airport all day and night and no one called me. My issue has not been resolved by Turkish Airlines.",negative

Every time I call, the customer service tells my case is in High Priority and Urgent email has been sent and I would get the response asap. I am not getting what does the Word urgent mean to Turkish Airlines. It’s been 7 days, I have been hearing that my request is made urgent and I will get the response asap. I had another call today ie. The 10th call and I’m hearing the same answer — ‘my request is made urgent and I would get the response with in 48 hours’. But my flight would be in 72 hours, how would I prepare for the international flight if you give me the response in last minute. Also its a covid situation, there are many things to be done before onboarding.

I chose the seat for one of my child it showed me 5.77 so I decided to pay that price and reserve the seat. When I was about to choose a seat for my second child I received a notification from my bank for 380.14 US dollars. I was shocked and frustrated so call the airline right at the moment without wasting a moment but unfortunately it wasn’t helpful at all. I asked the guy over the phone if I can just cancel seat selection since I was not charged what I was told. He said no because of our policy. My question here is why I was shown a different price and charged for a very different price? I have 2 other kids flying with me and I can’t afford to pay for everybody to have them sit together since I won’t feel comfortable sitting away from my little one. This is my first and last time ever flying with Turkish airlines. I’m going to open a dispute for that transaction through my bank..",negative

We missed our rental car reservation in Newark and had to sit in the airport until open. We got there so late there was barely any employees there for customs or to help with claims.

Because of that, we missed our connecting flight to Nevsehir. They were going to make me buy a new ticket for the missed flight but thankfully I was able to argue with them to rebook it. However, they made me pay for the overnight stay at the airport because of the missed flight. Now on the way back from Istanbul to Montreal, on my way to the airport I decided to check the flight status and guess what? They delayed the flight by over 5 hours without sending any notifications. We had to wait at the airport for 9 hours. I had to beg them to give us food vouchers because their policy clearly states that we were entitled to one. They initially refused and when they accepted, they made me walk all over the airport just to get some Burger King. Terrible customer service at the airport. The customer service representatives barely spoke English while working for international check-in. Honestly if you can avoid this airline you should.

I explained to them that we needed to be on the same flight since my wife was in a wheelchair after a ski accident. They tried to change the tickets for us to fly with Emirates to Bahrain via Dubai. After 2 hours of waiting, we were informed that my wife’s and son’s tickets could not be changed to other airlines since the ticket was bought with a voucher. A voucher we got last time when Turkish Airlines took us off a flight!! I then explained to the staff that we could not sit 4 days in a hotel with my wife's knee only getting worse and worse and that my son also had school to attend. We contacted Turkish Airlines in Bahrain who also tried to change the ticket with no success. At this time, 5 hours had passed, and no solutions were given to us to get us home to Bahrain. Since I was on a different type of ticket, I had to take the Emirates flights otherwise I had to buy a new ticket. Turkish Airlines staff suggested us to buy new tickets for all of us, paid by us, not by Turkish Airlines! We had not been informed at all. I received an SMS at 11:45am on the 12th March, 30 minuted before departure. We were informed that there were no more flights the next 4 days, so hotel onto the 16th March was offered to us. Wife was in a wheelchair and in great pain, had an appointment with doctor the following day in Bahrain.

Turkish Airlines staff suggested that we bought new tickets with Emirates from Zurich, using the train connection from Geneva to Zurich Airport, despite they knew we Had one person in a wheelchair! Turkish Airlines did not offer to pay for taxi, train or new tickets at all. They asked us to pay for everything, and whatever outstanding amount would be covered by the difference from Turkish Airlines compensation and our actual expenses. So we were promised full compensation by the Turkish Airlines Station Manager. We tried to get Turkish Airlines to get the luggage on the Emirates flight, so that Wife (in a wheelchair) and Son did not have to carry luggage. That did not happen.

Cramped seats, my legs were against the back of the seat in front the same as it would be with Easyjet (never use to be like that) for a four hour flight. The check in staff are so unprofessional.

It’s been 4 weeks and they have harassed, frustrated and caused anxiety to an elderly couple who is hospitalised in a foreign country and no compassion or help.

Just my flight is canceled the same direction and the same day why does Turkish airline lie about the bad weather if it is other reasons and now that I have to cancel again my flight back to Berlin because of the problems Turkish airline has made for me. I have to pay money and they contacted me at 3AM to ask me confirm the money transfer.,negative
224, I wanted an refund on my flight from Dalaman to Istanbul. The ticket sales office in Dalaman gave me an receipt to get a refund and say that they cannot refund money from there counter and I have to go to Istanbul airport. Here I am in Istanbul airport trying to get a refund. The ticket sales office here said they cannot refund because in their system the credit card I payed with is different to the one I have. Which is a lie. I brought up my bank statement showing that I payed for the ticket which is the card I am holding right now. The staff didn’t answer or solve my problem and left. Leaving me standing there for a long time. The next staff came to the counter and threw all my papers and ID documents in the bin! I asked her to stop and give my documents and Receipt back she said she could not understand English. And continued to throw all my papers in the bin and ignored me. I ask for the supervisor and he said that they did not throw it in the bin. I asked for them to bring up the security camera for proof and evidence. He first refused to go check the bin.  He then went to the bin and indeed found my documents scrambled in the bin. The staff who threw a way my documents refuse to show me her name card or name. ,negative
226,"Horrible experience! The airport staff are very rude and irresponsible. My GF who where traveling from LA to Tehran had 1:30 hour of transit only and they closed the gate right in front of her face! They charged her $170 to put her in the next flight which was in 2 hrs. Then they refused to board her claiming that her COVID test has expired! So she had to go into the city (Istanbul) to do the test again, but because her passport would expire in the next 3 months, they forced her to buy another visa with her other Passport (American one) to be able to go out of the airport. After doing the test, they said she's gonna miss her new flight, so she got refunded in order to buy another ticket for $500 which would take off in 2 days.  Finally, she bought another flight to go to her next destination after spending about 10 hrs in Istanbul airport checking most of the airlines. That's a big shame to you Turkish Airlines as you gonna lose all your reputation and credits if you continue the same way. We will never fly again with this airline.",negative
227,"I traveled from Toronto to Lahore by Turkish Airlines in Business Class. On my return journey on 20th February 2022, the plane was parked on the runway at a distance from the airport. We were taken to the plane by bus. I have acute arthritis that prevents me from carrying anything heavy. When I disembarked from the bus I could not carry my hand luggage up the stairs of the aeroplane. There were 3 staff members of Turkish Airlines at the footsteps of the plane. I requested them to help me in carrying up my hand luggage. They refused point blank and told me to carry it myself. I told them of my medical conditions and my inability to carry heavy luggage. But they were not moved and told me that it was none of their business. I was left stranded at the footsteps and could not go up into the plane. I was wondering what to do when a kind fellow passenger saw my condition and helped me in carry up my luggage into the cabin. Had I known such a negative and unhelpful attitude of the staff of Turkish Airlines, I would have opted to travel by some other airline. Turkish Airlines is manned by horrible staff, especially at Istanbul airport.",negative

I had already made my hotels booking and paid for it which is non refundable and also for my rides in Istanbul. I spoke to the call centre they said there are no possible flights available on 9th so I had no choice. So I chose to travel on 10th April later I got a mail saying that my flight from Istanbul to Bahrain has been rescheduled for 2 hours in prior so I called and asked the call centre agent to change the tickets to 22nd April as I wanted to spend 12 days in Turkey, he said there is no available flight on 22nd and he gave me an option that In case of rescheduling of flight I can choose any flight 7 days prior or 7 days later from the date of actually booking. So I chose on 23rd of April 2022 I said OK so he told me. He send me Confirmation of the ticket. But when I received the tickets it was given for 23rd March a month prior than the actual date of traveling I already lost lot of money for my hotels and rides because of you guys rescheduling the flight now I am waiting for the tickets to be given on 23rd of April from March.

229," Terrible airline, never ever use them. My family is still suffering from post traumatic stress. They denied boarding without any explanation to multiple elderly people as they couldn’t speak English and forced them to buy either a new ticket or ticket back home. My mother still managed to arrive to Australia after a week leaving in the airport with the same documents, but the airline denied their wrongdoing despite failing to meet their own regulations and passenger rights. We were not refunded for any expenses. It is absolutely disgusting how they treated people, just simply inhuman. What I have witnessed I would not wish anyone to experience. ",negative

It took several phone calls to get the credit because they at first said it wouldn't be possible to change the flight, then they said it wasn't possible to get a credit etc. When I called to rebook (booking with a credit on their website is impossible, also I can't even select my City from a dropdown list of hundreds of cities in my state. The website and the android app are unusable for anything.) They made a new reservation and asked me to call back 12 hours later to pay for the ticket. I called and the new reservation I just made was canceled. I took another 30 minutes on the phone booking yet another reservation, they said a Turkish Airlines rep would call me back to take payment. They never called. I called back and tried to pay for the reservation and again they said it was cancelled. This company is evil.

Furthermore, Turkish Airlines has not been staffing their check-in desks either forcing you to deal with outsourced check-in staff…",negative

Our flight from Cluj-Napoca to Lisbon (via Istanbul) got cancelled and we were informed by the airline through our travel agent in the evening before departure (we were supposed to take off next morning). We were going on a family holiday (with our 4 year old son). The cancellation wasn't followed by any alternative from the airline, we had to pursue the airline to come up with a solution but they stated that they had none, Turkish refused to transfer our tickets to another available airline, when we said that we would eventually agree to take their next available flight they refused to pay for accommodation (on this flight the stop over would have been 14/15 hrs). Turkish also stated that if we decide to use the return trip with Turkish we wouldn't get any refund at all. Basically we have lost 3 days of our holiday, 2 nights of our already booked and paid accommodation, travel insurance and we have had to pay an extra 1000 euro on a last minute booking for 3 new tickets with another airline. I would not recommend this service to anyone.",negative
233," Very rude customer service for Turkish Airlines at Boston Logan. I was told initially without any explanation your flight after Istanbul is cancelled, so we won't let you on the plane to even get to the connecting flight. They told us we would be rebooked but they didn't even pretend to care. I was told go to JetBlue for your answer. When I asked if he could write some type of note for me to take to JetBlue he said no. He wouldn't even call because “he doesn't have the number” Additionally, first come first serve was thrown out the window when one of the representatives helped someone in the back of the line while ignoring people that got there hours before the person. Also, it's near impossible to adjust trips because nobody comes to the ticketing center until hours later. Horrendous customer support, few answers, little to no explanations. If at all possible don't fly this airline.",negative
234,COVID came and Turkish Airlines promised to keep my ticket valid until March 2022. And they did. Exactly 3 days after they started flying again on 28th of March 2022 - so for the 31 March  they offered me a seat and my option was to get one this flight and no refund. Of course with a 20 day lead and a stay planned another 3 month that was not an option. And my guess is they counted on that.  Their Hotline had repeatedly affirmed a refund or flight. Courtesy was zero. Never again.,negative
235,"Turkish Airlines profited from my fathers death on their plane. My parents were travelling from Istanbul to Sydney with a stopover in Malaysia KL. For unknown (according to Thailand Doctors) reason my father died on the plane and the plane made an emergency landing in Phuket Thailand. They sent my dead father and mother to the hospital by ambulance even though he was dead for a couple of hours. We received one phone call by the hostess to say they were being taken to hospital and confirming my father had died already even though Turkish airlines have in their reports that he died in hospital. I'm guessing to avoid any responsibility. For the next several hours, every family member including grandkids were calling Phuket hospitals trying to find my mother. Imagine your 72 year old mother who has severe asthma, Crohn's disease and has had triple heart by-pass surgery stuck in a foreign country with high humidity with limited English. No thanks to Turkish airlines we tracked down my parents to a hospital ourselves. We are grateful for the Thai people whom were very nice to my mother. They police took her to the hotel across the road which was kind of them. However, my mother who had just lost her husband of nearly 55 years, in complete numbness and shock had to stay 3 nights in Thailand until a negative Covid test came back. That was the earliest I was able to get my mother out of there. Costs - Hotel & food about $300, Covid test $200, Compulsory Insurance during the brief stay $300. Now comes to my father, I received an invoice to the amount around $5,760 which around $2,500 was to go to Turkish Airlines fees to repatriate my father back to Turkey. We asked Turkish airlines to take some responsibility and at least waive their fees. They said no. So family members chipped in and paid the total bill. And even though Turkish airlines is profiting by $2,500, they have not apologised and accepted any responsibility in the way my mother was dumped and treated, not to mention keeping family members in the dark. Believe it or not they are still reviewing whether they get a refund for the unused tickets form KL to Sydney. Currently my father's repatriation flight was due to leave last night but was cancelled apparently due to ""mechanical issues"" so my fathers body is stuck in limbo unknown when next flight will be, even though we had made all the bookings on the receiving end. The costs keep growing and yet no apology from Turkish airlines still.",negative

240,"A very stressful and awful experience. Travelling out of Canada our connection after reaching Istanbul got delayed by approximately 8 hours. No email, App update, phone call or correspondence for this delay whatsoever. How we came to know about this is the flight update screen at the airport which we thought was glitching as expected time was showing as expected but had another value of time in front of it which was odd so hence we inquired at customer service.  Customer service was the most demeaning, inhumane and stressful experience. We couldn't even make it to the desk before an airline rep pulled us out asked our flight number and without any info about what's going on? what are our options? asked a question to us ""Food? Yes? No?"" I replied just want to understand our flight situation as nothing is updated or conveyed to us. He replied No food? Ok passport? I gave him the passport thinking ok some resolution finally but he took it went behind the desks, vanished there in the back in the kiosk and came back after 15 min. Asked me again, Food? I said  what's up with flight?. So again we got back in the line up so we could talk to a human maybe. Reached a lady finally, nicely asked about what's going on with flight and what are the options, accommodations. Lady said the flight that was at 9 is now in the morning (it took me good long time to get this info) she said no hotel we don't accommodate. Anyways back and forth she got agitated and threatened to call police which Ironically I should be calling as I was being robbed. I stepped back because if this was customer service imagine how police would be. Went to another line again now this time a gentleman, pretty straight forward told me he doesn't deal with that side of the business but can help me give options and the options was a substitute flight that will go to a different city and we need to figure out on our own from there. Which of course we took as I wanted to be out of there ASAP. Every single person in that line up, regardless of my flight or a different destination was extremely frustrated, crying or with hopeless face. So it wasn't just us with our first world problems I guess. On the way back to Canada (from Lahore to Istanbul to Toronto).  Without any notification our morning flight got 8-9 hours delay, we came to know about is due to my previous incoming experience this time I kept checking online status of departures through airports website because as usual Turkish Airline website and app were still showing on time. The Turkish airline office in Lahore does not open at times that displays on their site and there is no local number, agent or helpline to update your ticket when they delayed and messed up all the connections. (and no no email or updated itinerary) Anyways so we reached with all our luggage at airport just in case you never know. They finally open at 5 am instead of 2 am which the site said. Somehow squeezed in and found a number to call. International number, not toll free and the call keeps dropping, my wife successfully got hold of someone and they said they don't have connection to Toronto until Sunday which was after 2 days so either we leave Lahore on the delayed flight and stay Istanbul.",negative
241,"I was originally going to Nairobi on a trip in December. Because of Covid I cancelled my flight. I called the airline and they said I would have to make it an open ticket and call back when I am ready to book. They said it would be no problem. A few months later I called because I had a sudden break in my work schedule and could finally book a vacation. First time i called I was in the middle of the reservation and the call got disconnected. I called back to make the reservation and they said that it looked like I was a ""no show"" on the flight. I knew that was untrue. The agent said i needed to make a feedback request, I did and it did report an ""irregularity"" in the system. So then I was feeling hopeful I called to book. I cannot even tell you how many times I have had to call. A few times ""The system was down"" Then when I called back (each time I would get a different agent) they would say I cannot book this ticket because your name was wrong. My last name was written twice on reservation. They said please make a feedback request and they will change your name then you can book, so I did that. The feedback online sent to me via email was that they cannot change my name and i have to make a new reservation to do so. So I called back to make the reservation and asked them to please correct the name they said sure, we will forward the call to the feedback department. Feedback department said no sorry we cannot help you you need to do this online. So I booked the reservation on phone. She said just make a feedback online to change name. She refunded me $500 because new ticket was less. So again I made a feedback online, they wrote me back today saying You have to book your route again with the new name. Well how can i do that now that I have already paid for the flight! They said you can call us back or book online. Well I tried to book online and it asks for hundreds of dollars (asking like it is a new flight), so then I call. I spoke to someone, she did not even say hold on she just said okay I'll help you, she transferred me to another agent. That person said okay I will help and then never came back on the line! This is absurd. Now I have a reservation to fly from SFO on March 1st, but I probably cannot take the flight because my name is wrong on the ticket and no one will help me. This is the worst customer service of my life and I am really really stressed over a vacation.",negative

The employee tried to explain to us that the customs service of the Republic of Moldova would not let her pass with these documents. Because of this, we needed to buy new tickets from another airline and with the same documents that we had, we successfully reached Moldova. We contacted the airline several times explaining the situation and providing proof that we were right. But no one even considered our appeal, answering with standard forms.

I called back and spoke to another representative who told me that the actual cost of my flight change will be approx USD140. I said on this case I well not change my flight and leave it is it was originally. She said she can't leave it as it is because the change has already been made and I have to go to an office to resolve this. I couldn't get hold of an office so I called back to customer service where they told me I have to create a feedback form on their website and quote the number. So I did.

After 72 hours have passed I haven't heard back so I called again only to find out nothing has been done. I spoke to 5 different representative, some of which were extremely rude, but all I got was they would send an emergency note on my case and I will hear back from them.

After going outside looking for the transfer bus to go to hotel and finding out there was not enough busses or wait (no one knew how long in pretty cold weather) had to get taxi to take me to the hotel. In the hotel trying to call Turkish Airlines was also unreal, due to amount of people calling trying. I had to call some number in the US to get my flight changed.

How is this reasonable or acceptable. Wizz Air charge your existing customer 1.50 a minute and the wait time is over 15 mins. The live chat bot is pointless and of no help.

These passengers could decide not to travel or follow up the missing bags later. We then boarded to be held on the ground for 2 hours while they attempted to resolve what transpired to me a wildcat strike by ground staff. The announcements from the cockpit were few and far between and refused to take any responsibility for the situation or suggest any attempts to mitigate it. The cabin crew did not nothing to police mask wearing among the passengers, with people sneezing and coughing all over the cabin while not wearing masks. Indeed, the crew were rather casual in mask wearing themselves, with the purser frequently pulling hers down. We eventually left and arrived two hours late. Upon arrival into Milan, we were all piled into a crowded bus, again with no checking of mask wearing. Admittedly, the crew did offer free water and a small snack to apologize for the delay.

This is a loss of over £100 to myself due to their total lack of understand of the current situation. There was no remorse for the people suffering in the Ukraine right now, no lack of understanding as to why the tour operator cancelled my holiday, just a straight ""no"", you cannot have my money back.

She informed me that I needed to obtain the email address and phone number of the travel agent in order to proceed with any refund. I provided what information Google had which wasn't satisfactory to them. They suggested I contact them to find this out. Again, absoultey ridiculous considering they changed my flight. I eventually call back after contacting Trip directly, who were unable to provide this information. Again I was transferred to an extremely rude agent who again didn't provide any sort of refund or alternative solution. I hung up frustrated and managed to resolve the issue with my booking agent, who will make the refund request themselves. Extremely budget airline with no operational management skills, with obvious contempt and disregard for the customer. Likely all manner of profits go into the pockets of their investors and shareholders as the overall quality of this business is abysmal.",negative
270,"I couldn't even fly with Wizz Air because I couldn't book the tickets. They started off at £60pp. Having tried 4 times with 3 different booking services, I gave up and booked a train. Lastminute.com tried to book it twice, took payment then said they couldn't and are sending a refund. MyTrip tried to get the payment to go through twice, couldn't. The price was supposed to be £60pp. By the time I gave up, it had gone up to over £90pp. Each time, I got part of the way through booking before being informed that the price had gone up. I'm taking the train instead. It costs a bit more but at least I know I can actually get back from France. Hearing the horror stories of people who actually got their booking to go through, I'm glad it failed.",negative
271,"What a terrible flight experience. Check-in issues occurred online, due to ""website technical difficulties"", forcing passengers to do it on-site. Moreover, this company is surprisingly waiting for the very last second before letting the passengers get on board, in a totally rushed and disorganized manner. Unbelievable. To make things even worse, there was absolutely no guidance from any crew member resulting in passengers getting stuck for several minutes standing in the plane's main way not knowing where to put their luggage, in Covid19 times. Unreal. Better pay 10% more and get a decently organized crew team. Or go to another low-cost company. Is it needed to mention, the flight is way late on schedule. Never again.",negative
272,"Worst airline I’ve ever flown. Going out to Lanzarote the flight was delayed. The seats were awful and uncomfortable, it felt like they strapped a bit of plastic over a metal seat, never have I seen a seat with seams which run down both length of your legs which after a 4 hour flight just made indents into the backs of your legs, just to make it that more bit uncomfortable. Flight delayed both ways. On return they ran out of all food apart from Pringles. When asked they said it was because the previous flight ate all the food? (I thought the delay was because they were restocking?! No. Empty. Never flying with wizz air again.",negative
274," I don’t write reviews often but Wizz air flights are mostly late at least in my experience flying from Vilnius to UK. Today it means I will miss my booked PCR test appointment and other arrangements which will make me non compliant with regulations or not able to go to work, given that such delay is occurring very often. I think  this airline has to be highlighted as poor quality and unreliable so customers could make informed choices when possible and fly alternative choices to more reliable airlines",negative
275,"I understand that they have to make money in other ways since some flights are cheap, but that's just ridiculous. Before my flight, I had to make the check-in online for my father. At the point where you have to put some contact information, like email and phone number. Every email we put didn't work, saying that he email is already on another passenger, which is impossible since my father was travelling alone. After a few minutes, we read that this information was not mandatory, but we could not go further. After a while, we saw that, somehow, my father's 2nd name wasn't displaying. We tried to change it. BAM €92 for the change even though the first time was free, as it was written on top. After that we tried to call the customer service, which is €1.22/min and since everyone, these days, is using unlimited calls and data, we could not call anyone. They have no email either. To close it up, my father has to wait till the departure day and do the check-in at the airport, paying, again, €11. Will never fly with Wizz Air ever again.",negative
276,"From the start when entering the airport, there was a massive queue even though we purchased priority and my wife was pregnant, we were in the same queue as there was nothing organised on the floor and checking desk staff did not even care. The queue reached the entrance of the airport and still no one was doing anything about it. Going through the border was a total chaos, no proper signs, no social distancing at the time and they put us all in one very small room which pushed people to be nervous and kids crying and air con was not working at all so everyone was sweating. When the gate was open, they did not even make the same announcement in English so everyone rushed like crazy not knowing who had priority and elderly and families were struggling...the whole situation make my wife faint and sick throwing up and guess what it happened next to a Wizz Air agent who did not even bother to check on her or call for help or even ask people to make some space for her to breathe. We reached our destination and then we waited over an hour to collect our luggage, we complained to them, they said that their staff in Belgrade are subcontractors. That made me sick to the core to read that...all in all a really bad experience and we will not be using them again.",negative
277,"They are cheap but they use people to pay extra. I didn't make the check in online because I thought it's covid and you need to make the check in at the airport and in anyway I needed to leave my bag at the check-in. They tell me that I need to pay 40 euro for checking per person so I had to pay 80 euro only for check-in. I was asking why you make me pay like this, the employee was so rude telling me with a loud voice either you pay or you go back to your home - so rude.",negative
278,"Awful customer service. Awful communication and lots of hidden costs. For my return flight from Warsaw to Paris, WizzAir app wouldn't allow me to complete online check-in the day before, nor the same day, hours before the flight. I thought it was something related to Covid regulations, so I went to the airport as early as possible, and I had to pay 35 euros to do a check-in at the airport. That is, after I paid already for priority boarding at 42 euros, on top of my ticket price. Then upon emailing their customer service about the situation, with photos of receipts and boarding pass, they denied me a reimbursement, citing it was my responsibility to do the check-in before, whereas it was theirs to provide me access to the check-in. Also, their aircrafts are very uncomfortable, noisy, and they feel unsafe. And their flight attendants tend to be a little rough and prosaic. They have lost my clientèle for ever, and I will change destinations if I have to, just to not fly with them ever again.",negative
280," Their app is sophisticated and tricky. I had to change flight and did not see that they automatically changed my departure date. Long story short I had to reschedule flight and their ""changing fee"" was basically buying a new flight. Customer service is really bad.",negative
281,The worst airline ever. They charged for check 36 pounds in the airport although it was not possible to do it via internet. You have to wait hours in the queue to take your passport card either you have done check in via internet or not. I chose a flight at noon which was more expensive but out of the blue they changed it and put it at 7.00 am. I booked it for cheaper but lastly it costed a lot lot more. Do not book with it.,negative
282,"There is a new model of airline that desperately wants to undercut the prices of other airlines to get your business, and that is Wizz Air. They present a low priced ticket to snipe your attention and your money, then once you’ve committed your purchase, they add on all of the extras. Do you  want to sit with your young child? They’ll charge you for that. Do you want to carry a bag with you larger than a computer case? They’ll charge you for that. Did you want to check in for your flight somehow? They’ll charge you for that (they even charge for online check in). You get a cheap price up front until they secure your business, but once they have it, the stack on the extra fees until your ticket price becomes comparable to an actual reputable airline. You will not be able to fly without paying extra fees. Because I didn’t check in online the day before (because you know, I have things to do before I go on vacation) they charged me an extra $150 dollars just to do a regular check in. Then, because I had a cabin-sized bag and a camera bag, they charged me an extra $25 for that. Then because I didn’t pay for assigned seats they actually sat my four year old child away from us. They had it on record that he was four years old and their seating arrangement came up with that! Can you believe it? Sure we could switch it around so he wasn’t unaccompanied, but they were perfectly fine with separating the child from his family because a fee wasn’t paid. That’s a pretty gross business practice and I almost wonder if it was intentional because a fee wasn’t paid. For real. This becomes a moral and ethical issue when they will make a child sit alone unless you pay an extra fee for seating. It’s actually a disgusting business model and I will never fly this deceptive airline again. Just pay the extra money for a more reputable airline instead of this sneaky nonsense that Wizz Air pulls on its clients. So what is Wizz Air prioritizing? Cheap shot fees over customer service and satisfaction. DO NOT book this airline because it looks like a deal. It is not a good deal. They will loot you in one way or another by the time you get on that plane, and if you don’t pay the extra fees, they’ll show you why you better pay them in advance next time. Go with a more reputable airline that doesn’t hide fees and carry on such underhanded business. Somewhere a board of directors is congratulating itself for this business model. So much for ethics and customer service. Cleary a thing of the past.",negative

Everyone could have waited in a lounge rather than being crowded in a small area during covid pandemic.",negative
287,"Worst airline ever! Tickets are cheap and cheap is what you get, but they charge you extra for literally everything.

288,"The crew of this company has no clue whatsoever of how the boarding process should work. There is a surcharge for the passengers that pay for priority boarding, 2 lines: one for priority one for economy, most of the passengers don’t know the difference and the crew will not bother (not even once) to announce who should line up on the right or left. I traveled with this company twice and both times between 1 and 2 hours of delay. On my last flight I complained to a crew member and he blamed me for not asking people if they were in the correct line, I thought it was their job to make sure boarding process goes smooth, organized and respects the customers who paid extra money to board first. What’s sad is that both times the captain of the flight apologized for the delay due to boarding disorganization, yet nothing changes.

Result that the Check-in with Wizz Air is only Online, and it closes 3 hours before the flight. They didn’t even send us a email telling us this situation.  We ended up paying 40 euros each one for the check-in, a total of 80 Euros.",negative
290,"I had an extremely negative experience with Wizz Air yesterday while attempting to fly to Reykjavik. First, I received my boarding pass on my phone prior to arrival at the airport and didn't need to check any baggage, so I went straight through security and into the airport. Budapest airport doesn't announce the gate for your flight until about 30 minutes prior to check-in closing, so I waited around for a while. Finally, my gate information appears and I went straight to my gate to check in (almost the first one in line). Right away, I am asked for my covid documentation which I have in the form of the EU Digital CovidPass, which is accepted in Iceland and is what I obtained especially for this trip (I'm am American citizen and was fully vaccinated in America, which makes this a lengthy process). The girl at check in says that it is not sufficient and I will also need a negative covid test to travel. First of all! I checked the travel restrictions for Iceland several times prior to my journey and read in numerous places that a test was not necessary. ""Can you visit Iceland? Yes. All travelers – regardless of origin – are welcome to visit Iceland if they can show either a certificate of full vaccination against COVID, or a certificate of previous COVID infection."" - Icelandair I assume, therefore, that with my EU residence permit and EU Digital CovidPass, that I would be OK for travel. Second of all, neither that service that I booked through (Kiwi) or my airline (Wizz) provided any information about what documents I would need until the second I arrived at the gate, only 30 minutes before the closing of check-in. Finally, almost everyone who I interacted with was rude, and completely uninterested in helping me find a solution. I could have received a rapid test at Budapest airport in time, or there is a perfectly valid option to receive a test in Iceland and quarantine until the results return. No matter the suggestion I made, the Wizz Air authorities were disrespectful and adamant that I do not board the plane. And I believe its also relevant to add that I'm a 19 year old solo female traveler, for which the thought of missing my flight and being stranded in a foreign country is not particularly pleasant, however I was met with no sympathy from anyone during this experience. Extremely dissatisfied with Wizz customer service and refund policy. Do better.",negative
291,"Problem right from the minute i booked the tickets with the non user friendly website. Complicated I believe on purpose. In order to make booking changes, the site prompts you to make o phone call, selecting country and language, charging you at a very expensive rate ending up to an operator speaking only English. Finally the choice given to change the dates of traveling was costing more than the original coast of the ticket. No refund and no credit note. The reservation has been done and paid by me, on behalf of my relatives leaving in Greece. They didn't travel due to Covid -19 restrictions set by the Greek government during that period due to the fact that they are Health Civil Servants.",negative

Each time I have flown with this airline the flights have been delayed multiple times (up to 6 hours per flight), the last time being today. They first delay it by 20 mins then by 40 mins then by 1 hour and so on. They just told us “they cannot tell us at which time the flight will board/take off”, unbelievable! I have only booked this ticket as Wizz Air is the only company which offers the connection between the two airports which are most convenient for my needs, but I will definitely by flying to another airport just to avoid them.",negative

Staff at BUD had no idea whats going on. 1.5 hours earlier check in everybody at the desk, than half an hour later send us out, as another flight was supposed to start from the same gate, than check in everybody again for the 2nd time. After this giving vouchers to the passengers which are only valid on the day of flight, and in restaurants in the main lobby area so they were useless. I purchased priority boarding for no reason. They let everybody on board without any rules or plans. Staff on board very unfriendly! After all this misery we have got a can of coke and a piece of chocolate. Never ever again.

295,"A terrible experience masquerading as good value. If you don't check-in online 3 hours prior to boarding you are required to pay a fee (40€ per person in our case) for the privilege of checking-in in person at the airport. But there's more! They were not able to accept payment at the check-in counter, so we had to find a hidden counter at the end of the airport (not even labeled with Wizz Air) in order to pay. The payment system was painfully slow, taking up to 10 minutes per person since they had to document the payment through handwriting. This process took an hour to go through about five groups. No exaggerating. Then our flight didn't even start boarding on time, as the flight before us from Wizz Air was exceptionally delayed due to a large number of passengers needing to do the same process of paying to be able to check-in. That said, I am unsure I can rule out organizational incompetence as well. Now onto regular airline things: seats did not recline and no complimentary beverages or snack.",negative

Finally I managed to pay the outstanding £24 ,a few days later I wanted to download my boarding ticket i then received info that I couldn’t download my boarding pass because I was over £12 then realised I was charged £12 for spoilage fees due to my original purchase being underpaid without my knowing. The day of my flight I was still unable to check in which meant I had to arrive at the airport 5 hours before my flight, finally managed to check in after 2 hours because staff didn’t know how to help I got sent to 5 different staff members.

We had incredible difficulties checking in online and ended up paying a large fee at the airport. On our way back we tried online book in - it was not possible. There is a service hotline that charges incredible fees and a hidden service hotline that doesn´t charge. Calling the later a man with a very heavy accent answered. I had to tell him my booking number, which I did. It started with GG****. Upon spelling it I was informed that there is no letter G in the English alphabet. We agreed that actually there was a letter G. After a very treadful conversation absolutely nothing got done - I'm still not checked in.

So I had to stay all night on the airport and wait for my flight. I had important meeting in the morning in larnaca, so I couldn't wait for it. I decided to buy another ticket, of course with another company. Well Wizz air didnt refund me money, couldn't change the date of the ticket for free, even though was theirs fault and I paid more money for my new ticket.

We got up at 0300 in order to be at the airport at 0400 as advised by easyJet, I was emailed at 01:07 on the day to be told that our flight had been cancelled, they gave us under 5 hours notice! We decided to go to the airport to see what our options would be, as we were travelling due to a family bereavement. We arrived at Bristol Airport at 0400 to be greeted by a very busy easyJet check in area. I made my way to the special assistance desk as this had the smallest queue. We were approached by a easyJet representative, I explained our situation and we were rudely told that we needed to go onto the easyJet app and to sort it out ourselves, they were too busy to help. I asked to speak to the duty manager, who eventually came over to see me, they explained that we were expected to manage our own booking via the app, after explaining out circumstances and the reasons we were due to travel they agreed to transfer us onto another easyJet flight to Antalya later on that day at 1520, and that we would have to pay for the onward 6 hour road transport to take us to our original location in Bodrum, to keep the receipt and claim the money back as there policy states they are only able to book road transport within the UK and not overseas. We were advised that our original flight was cancelled due to crew sickness. Apparently easyJet had no standby crew available in order to allow our flight to Bodrum depart. No empathy was shown by any easyJet ground staff at Bristol. When we boarded our new flight to Antalya we were advised by the cabin crew that the operating aircraft had not been restocked therefore no duty free was available and they had very limited food and drink to sell onboard.

So we were forced to upgrade to “upfront seats” (+25€ per person) to have a cabin suitcase. This option also includes a priority check in with the EasyJet Plus queue to skip the normal long single queue for check in (see screenshot of easyJet email). We arrived in the Lisbon airport terminal 2 more than 2 hours in advance though we knew that we could have priority check in at EasyJet plus. When we waited for a while and finally arrived at the counter 203, the woman there was very rude and told us they do not have priority boarding today and that she doesn’t know anything about it. We insisted with the proof from our email we can skip the long queue at the check in counters. She didn’t even bother to look at what was written in that easyJet email nor give any explanation to why this service was removed “today”. She said the priority boarding is only for people who require special assistance. She was like “oh your flight is to Paris, you’ve got plenty of time” in a nonchalant manner. And she just spoke directly to the clients in the long queue, “next one”, waving us away.  No apologies, no emails from easyJet communicating this before we arrive at the airport and nothing was written before people started queuing. We paid an extra 50 euros for this extra convenience but they did not honour their contract and completely ignored us at the EasyJet plus counter. We spoke to the service centre (Portway) for the airline at the airport but the woman there also refused to help. Said she can’t do anything about it. So we waited almost 1.5 hours in the normal queue. After we got our boarding passes, I met a lady in front of us had the same case as what we endured, but worse. She was refused on the EasyJet plus priority check in queue and then refused her boarding because she was “late”. So she missed her flight. Both of us arrived more than 2 hours before the flight time (the check in counter only opens 2 hours before the flight time). But I had to run to the gates in order not to miss my flight.

The resuming of flights by Ryanair on this route will put them back on their knees from where they shouldn't have left. Unfortunately they will very likely try to hijack the Regional Government with artificial arguments, which by incompetence, ignorance or dissimulation, they could concede to even more 'support', as if they needed. It is how this so called low cost airlines work. Commercial aviation needs urgent supervision by national Regulators.

317,"Together with my husband and five-year-old son, we arrived at the airport in advance due to the purchased additional luggage (23kg) We were one of the first to check-in because many people who flew to Berlin at that time had a problem with checking in at the airport by Easy Jet at a time when other airlines (e.g. Ryanair) did not have these problems. Aweek before departure, we observed changes overnight in the restrictions introduced in Germany due to the prevailing pandemic. We have completed all the documents required by the German side so that our trip could take place. In addition, we checked the EasyJet app and EasyJet Hub every day to be sure that any additional changes would not affect our flight. The last change made to the Easyjet Hub took place on December 20. On the day of departure, the Easy jet staff responsible for boarding informed us that we would not be admitted to the flight to Berlin because we have Polish passports and we do not have a transit ticket (from Berlin Brandenburg airport to another airport). The situation was extremely stressful for us, because despite having all the necessary documents, we were refused a flight. We asked to contact the shift manager to confirm this decision, informing in advance that we had spent too much time trying to resolve the situation, which could result in the inability to change the flight (we could have changed the flight up to 2 hours before departure) we informed the staff that I am pregnant and this situation stressed me as well as my five-year-old son, yet we were told to wait for the manager's decision. After two hours, we have been informed that we would not be allowed to fly despite the documents we presented due to the fact that the staff interpreted the restrictions in their own way. We asked the staff for help in changing tickets to another flight, but we were refused help, suggesting that we could contact customer service ourselves on the number that we can find on the Internet.  I tried to call customer service to explain the situation. Unfortunately, each of our attempts to connect ended with a broken signal despite no problems with the network.

318,Both flight on A320. Boarding at HEL was chaotic because they were checking the vaccination certificate to passengers that had check-in electronically. At BER chick in was a breeze. Boarding was done with zone system; staff were easy going not creating problems with passengers carrying larger carry-ons. In flight service on menu buy items. Overall very good for low cost airline.,positive
319,"I booked 2 tickets 28th Dec on Easyjet, Gatwick to Geneva to go to France for New Year. I booked Easyjet insurance in case things went wrong and I could not go. I am a flightclub member. France banned UK residents from coming to France so now we cant go - we are not allowed. EasyJet will not refund the flights as they are to Switzerland not France.  Easyjet are not doing the right thing and refunding flights. I spoke to Flightclub customer service who told me I could have a voucher. But with insurance I would have to call the insurance number to get a refund. After a few days i got thru to Insurance who told me my insurance did not cover governments telling me I couldn't go to their country! I then called Flightclub back who then said no voucher was available as I was flying to Geneva - not directly into France.! So all I could get back was my taxes! If you are in a similar situation please complain as this is outrageous behaviour!",negative
321,"I used to be a travel freak, nowadays I try to travel only at last resort and do the utmost not to. Airlines have been very proficuous on dilapidating passengers prerogatives and rights, being mostly legally unreachable, with the exception of litigious proceedings. easyJet seats are hard as rock, considerably uncomfortable, resulting in a martyrdom flight. Paid almost 162,49 euros with 3 months in advance for this recent domestic flight in Portugal of 1 hour, 20 minutes and was assigned a middle seat. You are free to take your own conclusions. Very dirty plane outside and as usual lots of dust inside for some reason that I can't explain. I must say, having used them a lot, cabin crew was much more friendly when they weren't Portuguese serving other Portuguese, which in itself is an absolute shame.",negative
322," The cabin staff were very rude. I am a female traveler, who is short had a cabin trolley suitcase. I had asked the cabin staff to give me a hand, as I was unable to reach the cabin baggage shelf. He was very rude, telling me that if I cannot place the bag, I am not supposed to bring the bag. And then there is an announcement, about making the flight comfortable to the passengers in all possible way. This is unacceptable. I would never ever travel again through this flight. I have asked the cabin staff to just give me a hand, which even a fellow passenger does. Along with that, the staff has made a great statement.",negative
323,"Due to Omicron, I decided to cancel my flights for December 20th, it is now December 9th. Firstly, there is no Cancel button on the website. The online form does not include this option either. I had to call them to cancel, and even after cancelling they will not confirm it by email: no assurance of the cancellation. Secondly, even nine days prior, I will receive only the tax back. That means 90% of what I paid is lost. Absolutely poor quality process, as well as a totally overcharged penalty.",negative
325,"A flight I took recently was delayed 9 hours which meant staying in the departure lounge for the full duration of the delay. The delay was originally 1 hour, then 2 hours before suddenly being pushed from an 8am till 4.25pm, which also left late. I submitted an expense claims form as under EU law any delay over 2 hours is subject to compensation. The delay caused me and my wife to miss another flight and having to rebook that for the following day, an overnight stay in a hotel close to the airport, and two new PCR tests in order to travel. Easyjet accepted no responsibility for the delay and would not pay compensation for expenses which were booked before the delayed or after, surely there should be some consistency and it is almost inevitable that a 9 1/2 delay will incur further expense from travellers. I will be doing my best to avoid Easyjet going forward as this is incredibly disappointing!",negative
328,"Never again with easyJet. The deal is never worth it! Standard hand luggage isn't accepted anymore, unless you pay an extra fee of 24 English pounds. Think twice, and choose a different airline and save yourself the trouble of missing your flight or the extra payment while boarding your flight.",negative
329,Just flown back from Tenerife on flight EZY8704 10th November 2021 - can I just say how utterly rude the cabin crew were not to mention highly unprofessional! Only one drinks service the whole 4 hour flight then watched the head cabin crew member fill her bag with what ever she could from the plane! They basically sat on there seats the whole flight - completely disgusted and we definitely not be flying with EasyJet again - you may want to give your staff some training in customer service.,negative
330,"On Sat 6th November I had a call from Clare (DHL) at Bristol Airport advising me DHL have identified my suitcase & Iberia took it from Fuerteventura airport to Madrid as it didn't have a tag on it. I previously complained to Easyjet as the horrid lady on Easyjet speedy booking check in at Fuerteventura airport did not put a tag on my suitcase. Clare said she has emailed Iberia & Easyjet, but no one is responding & she doesn't currently know where my suitcase is. Easyjet have not once phoned me to apologise & I have received zero customer care from Easy Jet. Easy Jet are not communicating with DHL at Bristol airport to ensure my suitcase gets returned to me. Easyjet keep using Covid as an excuse, but they shouldnt operate/fly if they cant provide customer care. I actually liked Easyjet before this incident as never had any issues, yet the way I have recently been treated by Easyjet is disgusting.",negative
331,"I took a flight from London to Paris because it was cheap, but of course that is only a trap. As soon as I arrived to the boarding queue an employee was checking one by one, with a dataphone and a bunch of receipts, charging extra £25 to everyone that couldn’t fit hand-baggage in the space they reserve for bags. Next time I will definitely chose to travel with a company that goes upfront with the price they charge and offer a good customer experience.",negative
332,"Very good! No problem to check in online. No problem to drop baggage (took 1 min). No problem to embark with speedy boarding (but had to put my bag to overhead bin 4 rows behind my row which then delayed my disembarkation). Nice crew. Surprisingly good legroom. Landed on time. Bag on the belt within 10 min. Again, very good!",positive
333,Worst airline ever. Got offboarded on 26th October flight because the plane was too heavy. They offered us money (400€). After we got offboarded they forgot my bag. The support wont give me the money. Will never fly with easyjet again.,negative
334,"We decided to use Easyjet to fly back to the UK from Krakow and arrived at the airport in good time. We flew to Krakow with Ryanair and had all our documentation to hand and everything went without a hitch. We did notice that some passengers did not have a Locator Form but the Ryanair staff simply gave them blank forms to complete and there was not any problem. Our flight with Easyjet proved to be very different as we were returning home we thought that a Locator Form would not be required and there was no early indication of this from Easyjet ground staff. As we were checking in the Easyjet staff asked for our locator forms and bluntly told us to complete them online. This meant filling in a lengthy form and also finding the 2 day PCR test reference number, which we did with some effort and succeeded in checking in just in time. We were last on the plane and others who failed to produce a locator form missed their flight. Easyjet ground staff were completely indifferent. There was no indication given at any early stage which would have given us time to leisurely complete the paperwork. This was in marked contrast to Ryanair staff who made the flight effortless for everyone.",negative
335,The rating could have been better if they didn't use terminal 2 in Lisbon which looks and feels like a slaughterhouse and where passengers are made to endure accordingly. Fellow passengers also didn't make the trip any easier. I was just so desperate to get out of that airplane.,negative
336,"I had to buy 2 more tickets to get back to Ireland. I missed the first flight due to all trains from Victoria being stopped due to a poor soul who jumped in front of a train. EasyJet's policy is you lose the ticket and are required to buy a new ticket. Fine, I did that at the cost of 85 pounds. When I arrived at the gate for the second flight I realized I left my purse at security. The two gate agents would not call security and they would not give me the number for security. Hence I missed another flight at this point it became a comedy show due to the incompetence of EasyJet personnel, this was from the manager to a supervisor to customer service people who are clueless. Long story short me along with another couple who missed the flight because they were held in security needed to buy another ticket. This cost 110 pounds because they failed to inform us that if you don’t buy the ticket with more than two hours prior to the flight you have to pay their exorbitant fee of 110 versus 85. Then it took a manager and two supervisors 30 minutes to print my boarding pass. The incompetence of EasyJet personnel is laughable.",negative
337," Another excellent flight with Easyjet. Airport was busy but all went smoothly with no delays. Paperwork checked at the gate by very helpful and pleasant gate staff. Flight was full and departed on schedule and landed early in Alicante. First class service provided onboard by the cabin crew, very helpful and professional. Aircraft was clean and the cabin crew made regular announcements regarding face masks onboard. Arrivals in Alicante was great as no waiting about and all the E-gates in use. All relevant information like boarding gate and luggage belt was provided on the easyjet app which is useful.",positive
338,"Easyjet cancelled my return trip only 10 minutes after I landed in Milan without any explanation. Most probably they wanted to make sure to get the money of the first flight for then provide a lower compensation. I tried to book the return ticket with another airline but prices were astronomic, therefore my only option was choose the return flight provided by easyjet (for free) and shorten my holidays of over 1 day. It was a long weekend so it meant literarily spending half of the time expected. It was not because they cancelled the flight, but simply because of the very short notification that made impossible for me to find other suitable options for my needs. Greedy and unprofessional. Very upsetting!",negative
339,"This is the worst airline we ever flew with. First flight was 1 hour late without any notification so we were standing for 1 hour and waiting with no explanation at all. The second flight was cancelled 30 mins before departure, it was complete chaos as we had to stay overnight in Italy as they scheduled the replacement flight to be at 7am which meant we had to be in the airport at 5am, this was very inconvenient for us for many obvious reasons. They did cover the hotel expense but frankly the reason we are not happy is because the airline lied about the weather conditions being bad so that we would not be eligible for any kind of flight refund other than overnight hotel stay. How do we know they lied? Simple, other airlines kept flying and the weather in Milan was quite ok, not rainy or windy. Other reasons we were unhappy? We checked in our bag before departure and since the flight was cancelled we had no information whatsoever about where we can get our bag back , in addition to the fact that we didn't have any other information on what to do already 10 pm in a city where we never been before. They only told us to find a hotel and they will refund for which we had to search all over the airport and wait for such a long time to get this information.",negative
340,"This morning 26th September I flew BRS to GIB. The staff at check in were most kind, patient and courteous. A special mention, for Rosie who was a credit to the airline helping an older lady through the regulation and rigours of check in. I fly to Gibraltar several times a year and will continue to do so with Easyjet.",positive
342,"The staff at the check-in was rude. As a couple, we were carrying one small cabin luggage that was the appropriate size for the aircraft as outlined on the company‘s website. The check-in staff started a discussion and insisted that we pay additional 29€ for the suitcase. Not only was she rude in the way she conveyed it, she involved other staff to apply even more pressure. In the end we paid, as the staff started threatening us to not let us on board. The general perception of easyjet has never been good.  I usually stay away from writing any reviews, however easyJet staff is rude and renders a bad experience. Luckily, I am not dependent on using easyjet, which is why I will not book another flight with you.",negative
343,"Upon arrival at the gate in Crete, they charged €29 for a handbag trolley although it's the size approved on their website. Many of the passengers protested, but they were threatening that they would just leave without us, we were forced to pay for 6 persons €174. Funny thing is that when you paid you could take you trolley on board! Never again flying with this airline.",negative
347,"On Friday 13th August at roughly 20.00hrs our flight from Gibraltar to Gatwick was cancelled due to fog. After waiting another hour in the departure lounge, we were informed ‘Easyjet have been unable to find an alternative route or accommodation for the night. Please leave the airport by Gate number 5 and arrange your own accommodation’. After a frantic search online it did appear that all the hotels in Gibraltar were full. We were able to make contact with the host of the AirBNB that we had been staying at for the previous three nights and although his AirBNB was full, he made space for us in another property and charged us £160 for the emergency one nights stay. We took a taxi to his place and stayed the night. During the night we received an email from EasyJet informing us that our flight would take place at 18.00 the following day, 14th August. We therefore had to spend another whole day in Gibraltar. Obviously, we needed to eat and drink for our additional time there. At the end of this extra day, we took another taxi back to Gibraltar airport and thankfully our next flight left on time. A few days later we submitted an expenses claim to Easyjet for 2 x taxi transfers, 1 night’s accommodation and for meals and drinks during the day we were delayed. Easyjet have agreed to pay for one of our taxi journeys only! They have stated – the second taxi expense did not show a ‘route’ on the receipt so they will not pay. The food and drinks receipts we submitted were not itemised so they will not pay. The accommodation receipt did not have a date stamp on it (even though it was dated the 14th August the day after we should have gone home) so they will not pay. Easyjet flight cancellation actually cost us £289.00 and they have agreed to reimburse us £20! Not only did they treat us like animals and leave us stranded at Gibraltar airport with nowhere to stay, but when we claimed our valid expenses they have done everything in their power to wriggle out of paying. Next time I fly to Gibraltar I will 100% travel with British Airways.",negative
348,"There was no direct flight options on a daily basis to our destination and unfortunately easyJet was our only option. Knowing that we will have to pay for the baggage! After paying for the baggage, they charged us again for the carry on bags that are always allowed in the cabin (mine at least been to 100 flights at least). This didn’t make any sense, we paid 70 euro for the ticket but ended up paying 90 euro for the baggage (60 for the actual luggage and 30 for the carry on) I never check in my carry on cause of the valuable stuff such as laptop and jewellery. Worst customer service ever. Never flying with easyJet.",negative
349,"I was supposed to return to London via EasyJet and I was denied boarding due to a PCR test. Although I had checked twice since booking the ticket in June. The requirements changed again so fully vaccinated passengers required a PCR to enter the UK. However, the government requirements also stated that if passengers were fully vaccinated but did not have a PCR test they could enter the UK but would be subject to a £500 fine. The option of a fine was never given to me. When I asked for the customer service representatives name she refused. When I asked to speak with a manager she refused. I have never seen an airline which lacked so much accountability or with lower customer service levels. If you choose to travel with Easyjet and you run into trouble you are on your own.",negative
353,Overall my flight with TUI was great. Captain and crew were very informative and friendly and had a comfortable flight to Gran Canaria. I sat on seat 17a which I picked and the seat was reasonably comfortable for a 4 hour flight and this flight was meant to be on 737-800 and for a picky person into aviation this was a huge bonus as we were given TVs. Food and drink was offered however I got myself a Burger King prior to the flight however I did get a Diet Coke on the flight - forgot the price. We landed in quite hard and my favourite bit - the airport. Getting through the first part of immigration was fast and easy but when we had to joint the vaccination/covid test line which had 2 desks and 4 flights that was terrible. Then the baggage we had to wait almost 2 hours for due to a mix up made us even more tired and stressed. Anyway the general flight was great and I praise TUI and their crew.,positive
354,This was my 4th time with TUI! This flight was probably my best flight with them as the crew were absolutely great and we were on a 787-9 Dreamliner on a 3.45 minute flight. My only issue was boarding took ages and were using 1 bus but that’s not TUIs problem. We landed 1 hour late but that was fine with me. Baggage at Birmingham took 45 mins which is not very good- Overall a great experience.,positive
356,"On our flight no. TB181 from Brussels to Punta Cana on 15/08/2021, we sat in the Deluxe section and while the flight crew was very nice, a lot of passengers either weren’t wearing any masks at all and only had them hanging from their chins, or some just had them on to cover their mouths but not their noses. On such a long flight, I expected to see everyone wearing their masks correctly (except for eating & drinking, but people were not wearing their masks (correctly) for hours). The flight crew didn’t say anything, only when I asked them directly they managed to ask a woman in front of us to put on her mask. She did, but as soon as the flight attendant was gone, she made an obscene gesture towards a sign that told the passengers to wear masks and proceeded to free her nose. When we in process of landing, one of the flight attendants was standing directly in front of us, next to us was a man that didn’t wear any mask at all and loudly talked to his neighbour in the middle row. Both didn’t wear their masks, but the flight attendant didn’t say anything at all. I am very disappointed with the crew and especially with TUI fly for not enforcing basic hygiene rules despite the Covid-19 pandemic still going on. I will not be flying with Tui again despite having flown with them for years and I regret already having booked the return flight to Brussels because this shows the company doesn’t care for their passengers’ safety at all. To be truthful, I was horrified at how little the crew seemed to care - they were busy chatting next to the kitchen while half the plane was sitting without masks.",negative
357,"After several times contacting the customer services of this company, I am still waiting for an answer about why I didn't get the email cancellation before arriving at the airport, it cost me more than £150 to get the refund of my tickets. All the times I tried to contact customer services by phone (by email was impossible as they never send emails back), they hung up the phone without any reason. I can say that this company is the worst I ever seen, they are unprofessional and irresponsible.",negative
358,"This was our first time flying with TUI airways (UK) and we were surprised by the standard of service offered in this restricted time with the corvid restrictions. The boarding at Gatwick was done in a corvid safe manner and the cabin crew explained that a face mask had to be worn for the duration of the flight and whist in the arrival airport in Corfu. The Cabin Services Manager explained that due to Corvid there movement in the cabin was to be kept to a minimum and there would only be the 2 rear toilets in customer use and teh=at there was only t be a maximum of 4 passengers standing at any one time, also the there would only be one cabin service of food and drinks. We were given regular updates form the cockpit which were clear and friendly. The pilots pointed out places of interest on the route down to Corfu. Arrival at Corfu and deplaning was well organised and the Cabin Crew controlled the exit of the aircraft onto the waiting coaches. The flight back to Gatwick was an evening flight and again the Cabin Service manager explained that there were only 2 rear toilets for customer use and there would only be one drinks service. However, there was a tax free trolley has well on this flight has the banned had been lifted. Again, we had informative updates from the cockpit and were als able to follow the route on the drop down TV cabin Screens. On landing into Gatwick the exiting was well controlled by rows and seemed to be well practiced by the crew.. The onboard menu is very similar to other offered and is very reasonable in price and the food and drinks purchased was very good value for money. We did pay the extra for an extra legroom seat which was a good investment and there was plenty of legroom. Yes we would fly TUI airlines again and found the product to be excellent value for money.",positive
359,"When you book the flights on TUI website, it takes your seat upgrade money before it shows you what seats are available and what extra space you get for your money, which is wrong! After booking and paying, it said we only get extra 2 inches legroom for (£78 for 2 people). When I changed it, I was then charged a £40 amendment fee. I was basically charged £84 just to choose a standard seat, when Easyjet would be £16. The selfish TUI airline staff also shut the front aircraft toilets to public and kept it to themselves, and all people on aircraft had to use rear toilets. When I complained to TUI about people queueing in aisle and standing over me, I was lied to and told all airline companies have done the same during Covid 19 pandemic, which is a lie as Easyjet kept all toilets open to public on flight in same week. When I complained to TUI their response was the most unsympathetic, unapologetic customer service response I have every received. I will never book a holiday or fly with TUI again.",negative
360,"Gatwick to Enfidha. We were denied check as we were 4 minutes late this morning and have now been told we will lose our package holiday. This is absurd we were late by 4 minutes only, plenty time to clear customs and board, minutes late and this is how we have been treated. Told to deal with it with your insurance company.",negative
361," Due to Storm Ciara our flight was delayed by several hours and then we flew to East Midlands airport with onward coaches arranged to Gatwick. The Captain, came into the cabin many times to keep us updated at every stage and to answer any questions. He also offered trips/pics in the cockpit. The crew were great too. Nothing was too much trouble. We would like to pass on our appreciation for the great communication during a difficult time.",positive
365,"Booked a holiday to Kos on a Boeing 787 with TUI. ended up saying it was switched to Norwegian which is fine but then a month before booking was told we would be on one of three other airlines which eventually was Smartlynx. The Smartlynx plane we were flown on was plain white, 25 years old and cramped more than ive ever experienced. The table when down literally gave you no space at all, I cant image what its like for taller/ larger people. I appreciate there can be some changes to the plane (as per T&C's!!) but to move us from a new bigger aeroplane when we also had extra legroom to help with two young children to a small old cramped plane is unacceptable. They just don't compare. I wont book with them again as you cant rely on them to just change what you booked and not even a fair like for like change!",negative
366,"Stansted to Tenerife. TUI has the worst customer service. We flew with them in July and our flight was delayed over 24 hours - we were never given an explanation and no one in Tui seemed to know what was going on - it was totally chaotic. We lost a days holiday and have tried to contact them to complain but it is impossible to get hold of them! We have phoned, emailed, even emailed the Chief Exec - nothing! We will keep going but seriously don’t fly with them they are rubbish.",negative
367,"Operated for TUI by Olympus, this was one of the shabbiest aircraft's I’ve ever flown on. The interior looked like it needed a good scrub, my seat cushion and that of my husband next to me kept coming away and the armrest to the left of my seat was missing making it very uncomfortable (the visible metal to which it should have attached had been covered with a bit of silver tape). One of toilets also had no water in the taps. We paid for and got extra legroom next to the emergency exit but the seats didn’t recline and were so thinly padded they were uncomfortable. As the flight wasn’t full some others were moved to similar seats across the aisle but cabin crew failed to explain to them(as they did to us) what to do in the unlikely event of needing to evacuate via that exit (surely a breach of safety regulations). The jump seat in front of us was filthy and what looked like old tissues fell out when the crew member opened it. The Olympus crew were reasonably friendly and smart unlike the Tui staff who were completely offhand, surly and seemed only interested in selling. They certainly didn’t understand customer experience. Definitely not recommended.",negative
368,"Manchester to Tenerife South. From check in to arrival at the destination, everything about this flight was awful. The staff at Manchester airport check in were unfriendly and gave the impression they were doing you a favour being there at all. The cabin crew spent the first 20 minutes having a gossip with each other and sharing drinks. They were surly and scruffy (one cabin crew member had a skirt with the hem coming undone) and were only interested in selling, food, drinks and scratch cards. There was nothing resembling customer service. We paid for extra legroom seats which offered no extra legroom at all because the aircraft type was changed before departure. We didn’t buy the on board food but those nearby who did ended up with something resembling a dish sicked up by a dog. This is truly the worst airline I have flown with and definitely won’t be repeating the experience",negative
369,Cardiff to Palma. Had to pay extra £50 to sit next to relative which wasn't explained during booking. Flight delayed. Put on ASL Airline not TUI. Got diverted to Toulouse. TUI unable to get fuel there as no contract to do so. This led to further delay. All in all the experience was awful. I would not recommend TUI.,negative
372,"Thessaloniki to Birmingham. I had the worst customer experience with TUI services. I made the mistake to book a flight with them and they do not offer a check in online service (they advertise they do but their app, web page, customer support service is completely useless). I tried several times to contact them and complete my check in but no one was willing to help or even explain. Finally I arrived at the airport approximately 2 hours before my flight but I was not allowed to check in, although I didn't have any check in bags and my flight was delayed. As I result I missed my flight and I faced rudeness and sarcasm from TUI staff. Don't waste money or time to them.",negative
373," Dublin to Kos. For the first time in my life I met such dirty plane. It's not that it has not been cleaned after the previous flight, it's dirt from a few months. Terrible food - cold and pale toast with ham. Cabin crew okay. I would like to say: never again, but I have to return with them",negative
374," Doncaster to Menorca. I'm a very scared flyer and the pilots were amazing. They explained the route and weather conditions, and why and when the Aircraft would be turning to approach for landing. I'm really worried about the different noises in the plane and the reassurance from the pilots really made a difference. Very impressed. Thank you.",positive
375,Rhodes to Dublin. On way back we stood in line for 2 hours to check in. Then again for hour for security check. Then probably another hour for passport control before boarding. We were three hours early but flight ended up an hour late. Elderly and disabled stood for 3 hours.,negative
378,Manchester to Phuket. Very disappointed with TUI. Long Haul Flight Only includes no check in luggage. 7kg hand luggage is the only allowance included in advertised cost. It is then £35 each way for up to 20kg. It is then £16 to choose a seat. The check in is very long process. Waited 1hr 40 minutes as only 2 desks open for economy. No one checked my hand luggage for size and weight so their policy is void therefore a money making misleading scam. On board the staff were brash and let’s say tired looking shouting out “prosseco £20 Prosecco £20” Entertainment was laughable. Hardly anything to watch. Food mediocre. Toilets! Obviously not checked as smell of urine was strong and tissue not replenished. The whole experience was way below par. Never again.,negative
379," Birmingham to Cancun. Had a great flight, the cabin crew were very helpful and looked after us throughout the flight.  It was a great start to our holidays and am looking forward to our return flight",positive
381,"Lanzarote to Birmingham. Great flight with TUI. Served lovely snacks, and had great in-flight deals. This is the second time I've flown with TUI, the first in December 2017 to Fuerteventura (also from BHX). Pilot gave us speeches, and handled the take-off and landing pretty well. I would definitely recommend it to other people wanting to travel to the Canaries. Unfortunately no wifi, but that may be the type of aircraft I flew.",positive
382,"Boa Vista to Manchester. I cannot praise TUI flight staff high enough either going out to Boa Vista on 31st Jan 2018 or coming back on 7th Jan. They were all so polite and friendly and nothing was too much trouble and certainly helped the long flight pass. On the way out a passenger took ill and this was dealt with efficiently and very calmly and the only reason we new about it was because a doctor was sitting in front of us and was asked for his help. I have difficulty walking so had ordered a wheelchair from the cabin to the baggage collection which didn't turn up and the whole crew waited with me and my family until it came, despite me telling them to go home they all refused, even the captain. Tui should be proud of having such exceptional staff managing their planes and dedication to looking after the passengers. I have booked holidays with Tui many times and they are always our preferred choice and will remain so.",positive
384,"Bristol to Orlando Sanford. We have been travelling to Florida for many years but have been using TUI exclusively over the last few visits for the following reasons. They use Orlando Sanford which our preferred airport to arrive and depart from due to its size and speed to travel through. The planes they use are relatively new against Virgin 747s (Over 30 years old) and BA 777 (20 plus years old). Leg room is generous for economy. Flights are generally on time, with the last visit in September 2018, both flights pushed back early. The food is okay for airline fare, with plenty of drink runs by the crew. Overall we have been very happy with TUI (and its predecessor Britannia) and will probably look to book with them again on our next visit. Well done TUI.",positive
385,Manchester to Cancun. The flight was great with no delays on either of the flights! The in flight entertainment had loads of films to watch as well as TV shows and a variety of games. The meals were great and lots of them and we even got complementary drinks and food too. Cabin crew really friendly and a good environment to spend a 11 hour flight in and really comfy as well. Definitely recommend!,positive
386, East Midlands to Orlando Sanford. The service was excellent. It was our first time flying from East Midlands and with TUI and both were exceptional. The cabin crew staff couldn’t do enough for us. The legroom was excellent. Choice of entertainment excellent and food was good too.,positive
387,Ibiza to Bristol. Delayed about 1 hour. Bristol airport baggage information out of service. Baggage delivered about 1 hour after flight arrived and after other flights arrived. Not accepted.,negative
388," After stupidly leaving our passports two hours away, the TUI staff at Heraklion airport Greece were extremely helpful. Thanks to them, we made it on to the plane only to be greeted by a great duo who brought us lunch on board after hearing about our bad day! Wonderful experience of Tui and would happily fly with them again.",positive
390,Gatwick to Liberia. Following a 24 hour delay because the TUI engineer could not replace a windscreen wiper quick enough led to me and my new wife missing ultimately 2 days from our honeymoon. Following advice I contacted the after travel claim line to receive the compensation I am entitled to under law. Following numerous emails to the designated address (yes I have read receipts set up) I have not even had an acknowledgment of my emails. It is an absolutely shocking service from a so called trusted provider. An absolute joke. I would highly recommend looking at other holiday providers as this is not the first time Tui have delayed me and let me down. Shocked and appalled by a clear ignorant brand who don’t look after their customers after they have spent good money.,negative
391,"Aberdeen to Corfu  return. Temp was too cold, snack choice was rubbish. Even though we had a disabled child, and made this clear at booking, we were still at A and B seats (so had to sit with another person not in our party on the isle seat) meaning that every time my daughter needed the toilet or anything, we had to ask the man to move. He was very impatient and by the time we were on a return flight, we were forced to move seats, sitting separately. Really late boarding by over 1.5 Hours, departure area is terrible at Corfu Airport, so very very uncomfortable there, and there is no airport lounge. Food very expensive. Arrivrd back at Aberdeen in the early hours, too late to drive home, so had to spend night at airport. Airline staff OK but not very friendly or helpful, didn't listen to what was ordered. Would never book with TUI ever again.",negative
393,"Flight to Cancun, cabin premium. Evening check in of baggage at LGW is helpful if staying overnight at the airport and was easily done. As part of their premium package they include premium security passes and lounge access, security was quick, the No 1 traveller lounge was busy but fine for quick snack. The aircraft was only 4 months old so was clean and well presented. Welcome drinks offered shortly after priority boarding and Rituals amenity pack handed out. On time departure. The inflight service as a whole was very good, bar service after take off and menu choices taken crew very attentive with a real can do attitude. The first meal was nicely presented with main course brought out separately after started finished. Good inflight movies etc and regular bar services during flight for those that wanted it. A tasty afternoon tea was served prior to landing with sandwiches, Victoria sponge cake and scone/roddas clotted cream. The first officer made announcements during the flight which being both a day and leisure flight was a nice touch. Baggage off belt quickly. A very good flight. I have to conclude by saying that holding a high tier status with our flag carrier, they were the alternative consideration. However, having flown with them regularly, they would not have emulated the service TUI provided in their premium economy cabin and a 20 year old 777 would have struggled to compete with the Dreamliner!",positive
396," Birmingham to Malaga. Check-in for the flight was extremely chaotic and disorganised. Queuing barriers were arranged near escalators causing unnecessary congestion and confusion amongst passengers. Airline staff were no where to be seen to offer assistance and guidance to passengers. Boarding seemed to go smoothly however this was probably because the Cabin Crew were not asking to see boarding passes. My seat was uncomfortable and unsupportive due to the padding being worn out. Food and drinks were very expensive (even at airline prices) so would recommend you buy in the airport before the flight. The in charge crew member was putting on some silly voice whilst making announcements which literally made me cringe and squirm in my seat. My seat area and tray table were filthy and the aircraft looked as though it had not been cleaned properly in a while e.g. large clumps of dust around air vents etc. Some of my travelling party are former cabin crew and spotted numerous things that the crew were not doing e.g. not checking boarding passes? How do you know who is getting on the plane. Noticed a crew member not allowing passengers to put their bags in emergency equipment compartments however then noticed the same crew member shoving her own shoes, coat and toiletries bags in the same area? Crew in general seemed very complacent when going about their duties.",negative
398,"Gatwick to Las Palmas.  The customer experience made Ryanair look like a 5 star airline. Recently tried to fly with TUI to take my partner on holiday and get engaged. Unable to check in online for an unknown reason. Arrived at the airport check in area later than planned due to traffic, but on time according to the terms and conditions on the ticket. I was concerned about the length of the queue so sought assistance from a member of staff in Tui branding at the self check in desks, explained the situation and she checked flight times etc and told me we had plenty of time and to queue. After queuing I was told they had now closed the flight (while we were queuing) and we couldn’t board. I then had to run around the airport to find another flight. TUI’s customer services teams response, computer says no issues (effectively we can’t be bothered to investigate because we don’t want to have to compensate you) and the airport staff don’t work for us so we do my care (despite then wearing our branding). We flew with Tui on the return flight so I can review the flight experience which was nothing special.",negative

Apart from messing up our extra legroom seats, we then had to pay to 'downgrade' to get seats together. This was an 8-10 hour flight, but the facilities and food were atrocious - the cheapest, disposable, plastic earphones were totally unsuited to listening to a film - we both gave up. The quality of food served was on a par with airline food 30 year's ago - plastic chicken served going out and same on return. There are absolutely no frills whatsoever despite high prices. There is no comparison with recognised long haul carriers such as Virgin, Emirates, BA etc. This is short haul behaviour at long haul costs, with the added issue of paying to sit together (a Ryanair Scam).

It is impossible to contact them. I tried going through the claim form only to be told to call the number. I have called the number numerous times, only to be put on hold indefinitely.

I tried to call them by phone; however, since they cancelled all their hubs within the US they closed down shop and its impossible to reach them directly. You can reach them by submitting a ticket but that is ineffective and they use their policy as a means of not paying you back for something out of your control. This company is terrible.

Contacting their customer support is very difficult in the US now, since they no longer operate here and the customer service line is international, which caused me to incur even more costs.

Took less than a Minute at airport check-in counter to get my Boarding Pass. Generous hand-luggage allowance. No rigid luggage weighing and checks. Smooth boarding and dis-embarking via jet-bridge in both airports. Aircraft clean and staff alert, operational, and kind. Only half load. Departure early, and aircraft arrived 15 minutes ahead of scheduled time. Catering onboard was effective, though consumption is pricey. Announcements clear and timely. WiFi onboard working - apart from a single glitch. The ticket was inexpensive, less than 60 USD. Can’t fault anything, as good as it gets for LCCs, actually it felt like travelling with a fully recognised legacy carrier.",positive

Once we received the email from Norwegian that our flight was canceled, we called to look into a refund or credit. Not only did it take two weeks to get someone on the phone, but by the time we did, a credit was not an option for them. We explained we used a credit card we no longer had; the customer service agent said, ""We can't even confirm that was your card in the first place.""  She later said, "" the best we can do is push out the trip as late as August."" Okay, and my response was, and if COVID-19 is still blocking travel, then what? Sure enough, travel ban still in place, and I took her advice and tried re-booking it in this weird musical chairs nonsense and could not get through.

You might as well pay for the air you are breathing. Other airlines charge a bit more for their plane tickets but at least you’re treated like a living human!

The flight was very pleasant, calm and faster than expected. The entertainment was as good as the airlines I had flown for so many years. I didn't like the coffee but I never drink any coffee that is not a good Brazilian quality, produced and packed in Brazil. The food was not to my taste.

438,"Have flown Norwegian over 30 times in the last year both short haul and long haul. This trip was a long haul from San Fran to Stockholm via London. I am a big fan of the airline. Almost always on time. Very friendly crew, especially in the long haul operation. Free wifi for all passengers regardless of ticket type (both short and long haul) and operates gate to gate (so no annoying need to log in and out on take off and landing). The premium offering long haul is, I would say, better than most airlines' premium economy but not as good as business class. Yet the price is exceptionally low for what you get. Essentially you pay about a normal airline's economy fare or less for an experience better than premium economy. The food in premium is high quality as are the drinks and the seats are good enough to get a reasonable sleep (although this is not a lie flat bed per business class). The IFE is modern and high quality albeit with a slightly smaller range of movies than a normal airline. Whilst Norwegian are no Ryanair, it is worth remembering that this is a budget airline. You are getting a major discount on long haul with a normal airline but in return you need to follow their rules. If your hand baggage weighs more than 10kg (or 15kg in premium) they will make you pay to check it in. In economy, you don't get a meal unless you pre-order and pay. Short haul they are more flexible with the rules on baggage but long haul they always check. Overall, a great product for the price.",positive

When we arrived at the lounge entrance, the receptionist said that only customers who paid for premium flex seats could have lounge access, unless we purchased the tix last December.
