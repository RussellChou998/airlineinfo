__label__positive  Manchester to Cancun. The flight was great with no delays on either of the flights! The in flight entertainment had loads of films to watch as well as TV shows and a variety of games. The meals were great and lots of them and we even got complementary drinks and food too. Cabin crew really friendly and a good environment to spend a 11 hour flight in and really comfy as well. Definitely recommend!
__label__positive  East Midlands to Orlando Sanford. The service was excellent. It was our first time flying from East Midlands and with TUI and both were exceptional. The cabin crew staff couldn’t do enough for us. The legroom was excellent. Choice of entertainment excellent and food was good too.
__label__negative Ibiza to Bristol. Delayed about 1 hour. Bristol airport baggage information out of service. Baggage delivered about 1 hour after flight arrived and after other flights arrived. Not accepted.
"__label__positive  After stupidly leaving our passports two hours away, the TUI staff at Heraklion airport Greece were extremely helpful. Thanks to them, we made it on to the plane only to be greeted by a great duo who brought us lunch on board after hearing about our bad day! Wonderful experience of Tui and would happily fly with them again."
__label__negative  Gatwick to Liberia. Following a 24 hour delay because the TUI engineer could not replace a windscreen wiper quick enough led to me and my new wife missing ultimately 2 days from our honeymoon. Following advice I contacted the after travel claim line to receive the compensation I am entitled to under law. Following numerous emails to the designated address (yes I have read receipts set up) I have not even had an acknowledgment of my emails. It is an absolutely shocking service from a so called trusted provider. An absolute joke. I would highly recommend looking at other holiday providers as this is not the first time Tui have delayed me and let me down. Shocked and appalled by a clear ignorant brand who don’t look after their customers after they have spent good money.
"__label__negative  Aberdeen to Corfu  return. Temp was too cold, snack choice was rubbish. Even though we had a disabled child, and made this clear at booking, we were still at A and B seats (so had to sit with another person not in our party on the isle seat) meaning that every time my daughter needed the toilet or anything, we had to ask the man to move. He was very impatient and by the time we were on a return flight, we were forced to move seats, sitting separately. Really late boarding by over 1.5 Hours, departure area is terrible at Corfu Airport, so very very uncomfortable there, and there is no airport lounge. Food very expensive. Arrivrd back at Aberdeen in the early hours, too late to drive home, so had to spend night at airport. Airline staff OK but not very friendly or helpful, didn't listen to what was ordered. Would never book with TUI ever again."
"__label__positive 
Flight to Cancun, cabin premium. Evening check in of baggage at LGW is helpful if staying overnight at the airport and was easily done. As part of their premium package they include premium security passes and lounge access, security was quick, the No 1 traveller lounge was busy but fine for quick snack. The aircraft was only 4 months old so was clean and well presented. Welcome drinks offered shortly after priority boarding and Rituals amenity pack handed out. On time departure. The inflight service as a whole was very good, bar service after take off and menu choices taken crew very attentive with a real can do attitude. The first meal was nicely presented with main course brought out separately after started finished. Good inflight movies etc and regular bar services during flight for those that wanted it. A tasty afternoon tea was served prior to landing with sandwiches, Victoria sponge cake and scone/roddas clotted cream. The first officer made announcements during the flight which being both a day and leisure flight was a nice touch. Baggage off belt quickly. A very good flight. I have to conclude by saying that holding a high tier status with our flag carrier, they were the alternative consideration. However, having flown with them regularly, they would not have emulated the service TUI provided in their premium economy cabin and a 20 year old 777 would have struggled to compete with the Dreamliner!"
"__label__negative  Birmingham to Malaga. Check-in for the flight was extremely chaotic and disorganised. Queuing barriers were arranged near escalators causing unnecessary congestion and confusion amongst passengers. Airline staff were no where to be seen to offer assistance and guidance to passengers. Boarding seemed to go smoothly however this was probably because the Cabin Crew were not asking to see boarding passes. My seat was uncomfortable and unsupportive due to the padding being worn out. Food and drinks were very expensive (even at airline prices) so would recommend you buy in the airport before the flight. The in charge crew member was putting on some silly voice whilst making announcements which literally made me cringe and squirm in my seat. My seat area and tray table were filthy and the aircraft looked as though it had not been cleaned properly in a while e.g. large clumps of dust around air vents etc. Some of my travelling party are former cabin crew and spotted numerous things that the crew were not doing e.g. not checking boarding passes? How do you know who is getting on the plane. Noticed a crew member not allowing passengers to put their bags in emergency equipment compartments however then noticed the same crew member shoving her own shoes, coat and toiletries bags in the same area? Crew in general seemed very complacent when going about their duties."
"__label__negative  Gatwick to Las Palmas.  The customer experience made Ryanair look like a 5 star airline. Recently tried to fly with TUI to take my partner on holiday and get engaged. Unable to check in online for an unknown reason. Arrived at the airport check in area later than planned due to traffic, but on time according to the terms and conditions on the ticket. I was concerned about the length of the queue so sought assistance from a member of staff in Tui branding at the self check in desks, explained the situation and she checked flight times etc and told me we had plenty of time and to queue. After queuing I was told they had now closed the flight (while we were queuing) and we couldn’t board. I then had to run around the airport to find another flight. TUI’s customer services teams response, computer says no issues (effectively we can’t be bothered to investigate because we don’t want to have to compensate you) and the airport staff don’t work for us so we do my care (despite then wearing our branding). We flew with Tui on the return flight so I can review the flight experience which was nothing special. "
"__label__negative Flew London Gatwick to Cancun. TUI should stick to short haul - they obviously have no experience of managing long haul. Apart from messing up our extra legroom seats, we then had to pay to 'downgrade' to get seats together. This was an 8-10 hour flight, but the facilities and food were atrocious - the cheapest, disposable, plastic earphones were totally unsuited to listening to a film - we both gave up. The quality of food served was on a par with airline food 30 year's ago - plastic chicken served going out and same on return. There are absolutely no frills whatsoever despite high prices. There is no comparison with recognised long haul carriers such as Virgin, Emirates, BA etc. This is short haul behaviour at long haul costs, with the added issue of paying to sit together (a Ryanair Scam). Dreamliner? Nightmare liner would be more apt."
"__label__negative Stockholm to Amsterdam. I booked a flight with Norwegian Airlines, and then rescheduled the flight for an additional fee/balance of ticket prices. That flight was then cancelled, so I requested a refund (because rescheduling was ""broken"" on their app). They only refunded me the fee I paid to reschedule the flight. It is impossible to contact them. I tried going through the claim form only to be told to call the number. I have called the number numerous times, only to be put on hold indefinitely. I have tried emailing only for it to bounce back. I have tried to email them FEEDBACK, and even their website is broken. I have been scammed of 110 euros. DO NOT book Norweigan airlines. They will just send you in circles."
"__label__negative  My flight was cancelled by this airline due to COVID. Their system automatically selected that I use cash points instead of a refund. Later to find out this airline cancelled all international flights to and from the US. I live in the US which make these points useless if I ever go to Europe. I tried to call them by phone; however, since they cancelled all their hubs within the US they closed down shop and its impossible to reach them directly. You can reach them by submitting a ticket but that is ineffective and they use their policy as a means of not paying you back for something out of your control. This company is terrible. All I wanted was either to get my money back or provide some sort of credit to a company within the US I could use but they do not look out for their customers. "
"__label__negative  Norwegian Air sold me a ticket i May 2022 for a flight from the US to London, then cancelled it. They said they would give me points for a later flight, then months later they cancelled all flights from the US to Europe, making my points virtually useless unless I travelled to Europe to use them there. Contacting their customer support is very difficult in the US now, since they no longer operate here and the customer service line is international, which caused me to incur even more costs. They refused to refund me, extend my points, help me find a cheap way to Europe to use the points."
"__label__positive  Both flights were with same B737-800, going to RVN was on time, on the return flight we had 40 minutes delay due to airport closure. Boarding was done with zone system; stuff were easy going not creating problems with passengers carrying larger carry-ons. In flight service on menu buy items. Overall very good for low cost airline. Ticket cost considerably lower than Finnair’s"
"__label__negative  As I started to read through these reviews I felt more and more angry as the same issues were happening with me. Had flights scheduled in October 2020 which got cancelled due to the pandemic. We were automatically given Cashpoints which we did not want. Now they no longer fly to/from the United States so I asked for a refund so I can actually use the tickets I purchased. I have now gotten their boiler plate email response twice, like others have attached photos of. This is ridiculous and their customer service is awful. Like others have said, they have stolen our money and have no plans for us to fly with them. "
"__label__positive  Flew Copenhagen – Stockholm 31/8-2021 on a Boeing 373. First time in life, that used Norwegian. Eventless flight, almost boring. However, this is an indirect indicator that everything functioned well. No stress in any process. Easy to book, pay and fly. Check-in easy and several options are given. Took less than a Minute at airport check-in counter to get my Boarding Pass. Generous hand-luggage allowance. No rigid luggage weighing and checks. Smooth boarding and dis-embarking via jet-bridge in both airports. Aircraft clean and staff alert, operational, and kind. Only half load. Departure early, and aircraft arrived 15 minutes ahead of scheduled time. Catering onboard was effective, though consumption is pricey. Announcements clear and timely. WiFi onboard working - apart from a single glitch. The ticket was inexpensive, less than 60 USD. Can’t fault anything, as good as it gets for LCCs, actually it felt like travelling with a fully recognised legacy carrier."
"__label__negative  Flight was cancelled due to Coronavirus. After 9 months of being lied to over a promised cash refund, which they had stated would be paid to me, they filed all these transatlantic flights under a liquidation and offered 1% cash refunds on them. Utter frauds and liars on the numerous times I was in contact with them too. They led over 30,000 passengers on the same path, in the full knowledge they would not refund them and file for liquidation."
"__label__negative  I had a flight cancelled during the pandemic and requested a refund and they gave me cash points instead. Now I have been informed they are no longer doing long haul flight. which now makes my cash points useless due to living in the US. Now they refuse to give refunds saying that I agreed when I was given the cash points I gave up the right to a refund. The fact is they turned my requested refund to cash points without my approval. Now I know why, they never intended for any of the US flights to be refunded based on what I am reading on other reviews."
__label__positive  Oslo to Trondheim. Amazing airline that I highly recommend. Low cost so follow their rules and everything will be fine. The best low cost airline with amazing staff.
"__label__negative  This airline does not care about its customers. My family and I were supposed to take the flight from LAX to Barcelona in May of the Covid19 crisis of 2020. Even though our flight was cancelled by the airline we were not given a refund for our almost $2,000 worth of tickets. We were only provided ""cash points"" even though a refund was requested to be used on a future flight. Let me tell you, there are absolutely no flights scheduled from LAX to Barcelona for the foreseeable future. Do not book Norwegian Air!"
"__label__negative  My flight with Norwegian was booked for 22 May, but I had to cancel it due to Covid-19. Originally they told me I would be given 'Cash Points' for use against a future flight. After months of pursuing them for my Cash Points (their on-line claim system did not work) I finally received an email saying that Cash Points were not being given on internal flights, so no refund would be made apart from taxes. I had other internal flights in Norway booked with SAS. I also had to cancel these. Full credit voucher given within 24 hours for use in next two year. Norwegian - take some lessons in customer care."
"__label__negative  My husband and I booked a trip to Paris for March 2020 that got canceled due to COVID-19. The original booking was made the year before months in advance on a credit card. By the time the trip arrived, we had paid off this card and canceled it on good terms. Once we received the email from Norwegian that our flight was canceled, we called to look into a refund or credit. Not only did it take two weeks to get someone on the phone, but by the time we did, a credit was not an option for them. We explained we used a credit card we no longer had; the customer service agent said, ""We can't even confirm that was your card in the first place.""  She later said, "" the best we can do is push out the trip as late as August."" Okay, and my response was, and if COVID-19 is still blocking travel, then what? Sure enough, travel ban still in place, and I took her advice and tried re-booking it in this weird musical chairs nonsense and could not get through. Now the time has passed, and my husband and I are out almost two thousand dollars. Would it have killed them to extend a flight voucher for a later date?"
"__label__positive We booked way back but guessed it would be cancelled due to covid. 4th July recieved notification of cancelled flight 5th July, completed the on line form for a full refund, 7th July full refund received. I can only guess that those complaining tried to obtain the refund by phone.  If they survive, I will have no hesitation in booking for Miami next year. Other airlines need to see how Norwegian deal with things and follow. "
__label__negative  Still waiting for full refund a full 4 months after they cancelled in April due to coronavirus. Customer relations department does not respond to any requests for information or updates. 
"__label__negative  Norwegian changed our return ticket 1 day after arriving on Crete and removed 3 days of holiday. From 10 to 7 days holiday and even though there were several other flights we could have taken the same day as we were supposed to go they just didn't care and just presented us with a gun-to-the-head policy, where we either could choose to stay in Crete or go back 3 days earlier. The kids who had their first real holiday in years are devastated. And just for the record - I had already contacted Norwegian several times before to be sure there were no issues with our tickets in these corona times."
"__label__negative  I bought a premium flex ticket so should have no reason not to get a full refund for a cancelled flight. I was expecting to fly on July 8, 2020 but cancelled due to Covid. I am still not getting refunded and called 3 times already and filed a claim with the airline but still not receiving my refund. They keep telling me to wait but it is taking too long."
__label__negative  Norwegian cancelled my ticket because of covid-19 what is fully acceptable. I ask for full refund they writed me that it will take around 2-3 weeks to get my money back. After 3 weeks they sent me the same email to fill the same form to apply for money refund. I'm waiting almost 7 weeks. I call the service they told me just wait or choose a new flight instead.
"__label__negative  Norwegian's website is as clear as mud. They  make it very difficult to find answers or contact them directly. I spent about an hour trying to figure out how to cancel my flight in June due to the pandemic. You'd think this process would be clear and featured given the current state of affairs. I found something that mentioned you have to cancel the flight, then apply for a refund. It was not specific. I cancelled the flight and then could not figure out how to file a claim. Come to find out, I had to wait to see if they canceled the flight. Now I have no recourse in getting my money back, even if they do cancel the flight. "
"__label__negative  Gatwick to New York in June 2020. I would like to cancel my trip due to COVID-19, but Norwegian is offering cash points instead of a refund. Even without the pandemic I wasn't sure how long it would be until I got the chance to travel internationally again, but now with the virus my next flight is even more up in the air and I'd hate for $300 worth of cash points to just be sitting in my account for years. Calling is to no avail and there isn't an email that I can find for me to contact. This is very inconvenient for me and my family."
"__label__negative  I called the booking site ""FlyFar"" today and allegedly the agents have been requesting refunds from Norwegian since last month. They are offering travel credits to fly by Dec. 31st 2020, when we do not even know when COVID-19 will end to make sure it is safe for us to fly. They refuse to process flights for those us who have been extremely inconvenienced by this COVID-19. "
"__label__negative  Oakland to Oslo in October 2019. The flight was booked for a price of $803.51 round trip total for myself and my companion. For each leg, we were provided an opportunity to ""Bid for an upgrade."" For each leg, I intended to bid 10% additional (about $40 in each case) but I found the process confusing. I was shocked to find that I was billed a total of $1834.50 for the trip, which is a 128% increase in the fare as opposed to my intended 10% increase. I contacted Norwegian Air and was refused any adjustment. In the end, this confusing upgrade process and refusal to provide a reasonable settlement appears to be a corporate strategy to enhance the bottom line with no regard for customer satisfaction."
"__label__negative  No meaningful customer service, no reasonable accommodations for matter related to Coronavirus.

"__label__negative London Gatwick to Oslo. Terrible, absolutely terrible experience. Flight got cancelled while already ín the plane (with at that point already an hour delay). We got off loaded and basically not provided with any clear information for the next 5 hours. Currently, the replacement flight keeps being pushed. I’m lucky if I get out of here today at all. Staff is extremely unhelpful and unfriendly. Oh, and I got a voucher of 7,5£ to cover 8 hrs of waiting. 7,5£ in Uk will get me 1 water. I will never fly with you again."
"__label__negative  Everything was going well until a sand storm hit the Canary Islands. We were half way there and had to return to Gatwick. Norwegian staff were useless in giving information. They put us up at the Gatwick Hilton for the night and said that they would contact us with any updates. They did not do this. They gave us a phone number to call, waste of time because nobody answers the phone. They said that they would email us with updates, even that didn't happen. We have lost 1 day of our holiday and their attitude is tough luck. Other planes are flying out to the Canary Islands today. But Norwegian are not. They have not even offered another flight on another airline. Totally unhappy."
"__label__negative  One of the worst airlines I have flown with. It was my first trip to Europe and I was ecstatic, that is until I had to deal with this airline. Their airline tickets were cheap but don’t be fooled, they will get their money from you one way or another. They weigh your carry on bags and personal items before you can board the plane. I was over the 10kg or 22lbs allowed and they charged $120 to check the bag (one way). They do not feed nor give complimentary drinks including water! You might as well pay for the air you are breathing. Other airlines charge a bit more for their plane tickets but at least you’re treated like a living human! How do they expect you to be on a 10hr flight without any food or water. I’ve learned my experience and will never fly Norwegian again."
"__label__positive  New York JFK to Gatwick. Original flight booked with Norwegian Air was cancelled so we lost the price of our nonrefundable American airline tickets to JFK. We scheduled a later Norwegian flight and paid for two more airline American Airline tickets to JFK. Not happy that the original flight was cancelled but Norwegian did step up and reimburse us for the two original nonrefundable tickets to JFK. Was pleasantly surprised that Norwegian Air did this. Our flight from JFK to Gatwick was no frills but the plane was nice and it was a great value. Yes, we would fly Norwegian Air again. Thank you Norwegian Air."
"__label__negative Terrible airline, I’m not going to use it again. I was flying from Madrid to Los Angeles, we boarded and we had a 1.5 Hours delay. It’s around a 12 hour flight. They don’t serve free food or water. You have to buy it. The cabin was so cold. We ordered some food - my food was disgusting and expensive. The flight tickets were not cheap and in addition, there is no free baggage. I was carrying hand luggage and was only 1.5 kg overweight (allowed 10 kg) and they made me pay 90 euros for that."
"__label__positive  Rio de Janeiro to Gatwick. I have flown to Brazil every year since 30 years ago when I moved to England. I have always flown British Airways. I understand why long haul flights are and can be so expensive, nonetheless I try to get the best price possible for a direct flight. I couldn't believe my luck to find out that a prestigious airline was providing a direct flight from the closest airport to me (1 hour away), and less than half of the cost for a round trip. The staff were very polite, friendly and smiley. I told them I was a nervous flier and 30 minutes or so after the take off one of the staff came and offered me to change seats to a less crowded part of the plane.  The flight was very pleasant, calm and faster than expected. The entertainment was as good as the airlines I had flown for so many years. I didn't like the coffee but I never drink any coffee that is not a good Brazilian quality, produced and packed in Brazil. The food was not to my taste.  The flight back from Rio was as good, and we arrived 22 minutes ahead schedule. I was very pleased with Norwegian and I will fly with them whenever I need to if they keep providing their services from Gatwick. Thank you. A happy customer."
__label__negative  Copenhagen to Gatwick. Our flight was delayed by 4 hours. The only communication I received was 2 text messages with approximate departure time. When arrived to the airport there was no a single representative of the airline to explain what was happening with the flight. In the text message they sent they asked to arrive to the airport at the original time and go straight to gate C36. You have to go through passport control and there is no way out. In that area there was no one to talk to passengers and explain what was going on. The flight kept being delayed and the only way to know it was to go online and see that there were new times. There was no information at the airport on the screen. They offered meal voucher but there was no one giving those vouchers out. They kept claiming via chat on Facebook this was due to the weather but other flights were going to either Heathrow or Gatwick. 
"__label__negative Berlin to Oslo. My roller bag was overweight so could not be a carry on and I had to check it at a cost of 90 euros per leg. I have never had a good experience with their ticket counter, they are short with me and seem to be bothered by my mere presence. I would never recommend this airline."
"__label__negative  Denver to London Gatwick. Stranded at 1am after an 8.40pm flight got cancelled. The staff delayed and delayed us with little information or compensation other than a meal ticket. When they finally cancelled on us, 700+ people had to find somewhere to sleep at 1am and they didn't fly us until the next evening. The staff were rude and unhelpful. Their contact center is useless, forget ever getting any compensation, and no tickets under any circumstances are refundable because this business doesn't support it's customers. Do not fly with them, no matter how good their prices are, once you finally board (and they're often late) the experience is less than satisfactory, TV screen didn't work, uncomfortable seats, terrible food, grumpy staff."
"__label__negative Los Angeles to Barcelona. No, and if you do, do not say you were not warned. They have changed since they started having financial problems. They will get more money from you than you originally planned. It's their new thing. I read all the notices. I weighed my bags. They still got me for $880 in addition to the amount I booked for two tickets. They added upgrades without my approval. I was not given upgrades I had, even with an email proof. They were rude. They handled everything horribly. There were painfully long delays that were caused by the airline's incompetence. I'm really good at traveling on economy airlines. I don't need food and water. I don't need a lot of room. But I expect to be treated with respect, and I do not expect to be scammed. And forget about working things out with their customer service department after the fact. They have nothing to gain from refunding you diddly. If you are flying to Barcelona, take TAP - same price but they are a real airline. You have been warned."
"__label__positive  New York to London Gatwick. First time flyer with Norwegian, hopefully not the last. When I booked this flight, I read reviews after I had booked the flight and was horrified. This was for my husband’s birthday. However, we absolutely loved it. The airline was prompt, clean, all the staff were courteous from check in to leaving the plane. I would totally recommend flying with them. Flying home, we bid for premium seats and we lucky enough to get them, big seats lots of leg room, attentive staff. Please ignore all the horrific reviews. They were amazing."
"__label__positive  Have flown Norwegian over 30 times in the last year both short haul and long haul. This trip was a long haul from San Fran to Stockholm via London. I am a big fan of the airline. Almost always on time. Very friendly crew, especially in the long haul operation. Free wifi for all passengers regardless of ticket type (both short and long haul) and operates gate to gate (so no annoying need to log in and out on take off and landing). The premium offering long haul is, I would say, better than most airlines' premium economy but not as good as business class. Yet the price is exceptionally low for what you get. Essentially you pay about a normal airline's economy fare or less for an experience better than premium economy. The food in premium is high quality as are the drinks and the seats are good enough to get a reasonable sleep (although this is not a lie flat bed per business class). The IFE is modern and high quality albeit with a slightly smaller range of movies than a normal airline. Whilst Norwegian are no Ryanair, it is worth remembering that this is a budget airline. You are getting a major discount on long haul with a normal airline but in return you need to follow their rules. If your hand baggage weighs more than 10kg (or 15kg in premium) they will make you pay to check it in. In economy, you don't get a meal unless you pre-order and pay. Short haul they are more flexible with the rules on baggage but long haul they always check. Overall, a great product for the price."
"__label__negative  Los Angeles to Paris return in September 2019.

We were told that our seats we had chosen 6 months earlier, were changed (we were separated in the cabin; I was in the front, he in the back!) because the airline eliminated our flight and put us on a later flight. We thought we'd hang out in the lounge.  When we arrived at the lounge entrance, the receptionist said that only customers who paid for premium flex seats could have lounge access, unless we purchased the tix last December. I told her that we did purchase them last December, but she said I'd have to provide proof.  On the flight home, the crew was very nice. Three hours before the end of the flight, an announcement was made that there was no more potable water.  I demanded compensation, and Norwegian said they'd pay us $60 for our troubles, but we'd have to provide a routing number for our bank. I didn't feel comfortable with that request; I asked to receive a voucher in that amount for the next trip. The answer was  that was the only way they could send any money.

But one month before, Norwegian sent us an email saying the 3pm flight has now been changed to 10am on 1/12 when we are still in mid-air flying from London to Helsinki. No choice, we opted for their rescheduled flight Helsinki to Rovaniemi the next day.  When we need a reason for their cancellation, as requested by our insurance company, they have yet to reply our online request. Our flight from Helsinki to Stockholm, Stockholm to Paris on 9/12/19 also met with the same fate of a flight cancellation. Taking no chances, we cancelled these 2 sectors totally and paid a premium for Air France flight. So out of 5 sectors booked with Norwegian, we have 2 sectors cancelled. "

In Fort Lauderdale they told me I may have to be bumped because I had a low fare ticket because they were using a different aircraft. I ended up getting on the flight and they told me I could make it to Milan. When we landed we had to go out of baggage claim to get help. They put us on a Brussels Air flight that connected through Brussels and into a different Milan airport 8 hours later at 10:15pm. They refused to pay for an overnight or help with transportation even though I may have to buy a hotel due to the very late arrival. They do not have free blankets or pillows onboard.
