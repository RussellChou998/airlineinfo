"__label__positive Regular Ryanair customer. Flew back from Alicante on Friday 18 th March 2022 into Shannon. Perfect flight and landed 15 minutes early. But wanted to commend a few things. The cabin crew were excellent, very professional. The landing was so smooth I didn’t realise we where on the ground. But I do wish to single out the senior flight attendant. I was carrying some duty free as well as my 10 kg case which was heavy. The steps off the plane were steep which normally I’ll cope with. But I asked this young man if I could leave my case till I get down the steps and then come back up and get it. Not at all he said I’ll take down for you. He was a gentleman. I thanked him and he said it was his pleasure. One final thought it was the first time I heard senior cabin crew thank his colleagues for their help and hard work during flight. Nice touch I thought. I know this man was not Irish but thanked the passengers for flying Ryanair in Irish. Excellent. To be commended. Well done Ryanair customer service. "
__label__positive  The flight from Poznan to Birmingham was most enjoyable flight. We fly 3-4 times a month but never received service like this. 
"__label__positive Let me make it short. Near on time departure early arrival. Super friendly check in as security staff at Charleroi airport (love Belgian hospitality). Fantastic crew on airplane giving very professional service so much so that one of the ladies airline stewardesses took care of a baby while her mother went to the restrooms. Perfect service for a very cheap price, Ryanair I am a very satisfied customer."
__label__positive  I flew from Prestwick to Arrecife on 20/11/2020. Ground staff very friendly and helpful. The cabin crew were excellent. Really efficient providing a fantastic onboard service all with a smile and couldn't do enough. 
"__label__positive  I was quite apprehensive about booking with Ryanair having read many poor reviews, so, I read and reread the booking site until I understood what was required. The booking process was simple and easy to follow and I completed it without problems. There was a flight time change which was notified by email. On the days of travel both flights were on time, both staffed by pleasant and efficient cabin crew. The cabin was clean and Covid rules were followed. The seats were OK for short haul flights but hard. We used neither catering or duty free purchasing.We had an enjoyable experience and have no complaints. We will certainly do it again."
__label__positive  I hadn't been travelling for 2 years since covid. I used to travel a lot but always was flight 'sick'! I hate take-offs and landings and I think that the best take-offs I had in years was on my flight to London! It was smooth and neat! Pilots don't often get to be congratulated on their skills but I do believe that it takes a lot to ensure that the experience on the flight is seamless even with a couple of turbulences! So congrats to the crew for making me want to travel again despite my fears!
"__label__positive Just to record praise where it’s due. For some reason unknown to myself, despite flying about a hundred flights a year for years, I stupidly forgot my passport for this trip to Seoul. I managed to retrieve with Uber from home but it meant I was still at checkin just 20 mins before departure. The SAS/Lufthansa checkin staff did an amazing job and showed incredible flexibility to somehow get me onboard. Thanks a million for fantastic service which won’t be forgotten!"
"__label__positive I wanted to thank Emmanuel Ramos and his team for helping my husband and I navigate the airport boarding, ticketing and assist with our 2 oversized pets. His behavior was extremely professional and kind in a hectic environment and he multi-tasked consistently and cheerfully. He went above and beyond to help make our flight comfortable and make sure that we had everything squared away. If he is an example of the kind of people that Lufthansa hires, than it is no wonder that they are a 5 star airline! Such excellent service!"
"__label__positive  Wonderful flights, flying like in the good old days. Good food, open bar, friendly FAs, good IFE with lots of good films/music, even on short European flights you get a snack and an open bar. They even let me check my bag for free both ways. Fantastic."
"__label__positive I booked with KLM which was a nightmare. I was supposed to fly Air France SG to Rome and with KLM from Rome to SG but I changed my flight. Since my booking was made with KLM, it was impossible to get a hold of anyone when my VTL flight was cancelled and I was reassigned a non VTL flight. Air France was very professional despite my upset state and rearranged everything for me, and both my flights during this trip was extremely pleasant. The crew was very nice and helpful. I would next time just book directly with Air France. I would like to add that ground staff at CDG did a great job too. Thank you Air France!"
"__label__positive  Short flight on a brand new two and a half week old airplane. Air France delivered great service as expected. Check in at Charles de Gaulle was quick and friendly, but the terminal was pretty full once we got to security. Boarding was very fast on this full flight. I ended up falling asleep so didn’t get a snack but when I woke up I was offered two bottle of wine by the crew. Upon landing in Madrid I was able to take a picture of the cockpit. Very nice plane with a brand new smell and friendly crew. "
"__label__positive  Flew Air France for the first time on Thanksgiving Day for a quick trip to Europe. Check in was a breeze since the flight was only had full, once we boarded they’re was a blanket, pillow and headphones on each seat. Most passengers had their own row, which was great since it was an overnight flight and sleep was needed. Service onboard was fantastic, tasty dinner with champagne and wine, snacks in the back for mid flight and prior to landing a small baggie with a quick breakfast was offered. Inflight entertainment had a very good choice of movies and music to pass the time along."
"__label__positive  The best flight since Covid on any carrier. Efficient friendly service, delicious food and drinks served in glassware and cutlery. Proving current cuts in service on other carriers is not as claimed, Covid related. Good seat, good entertainment, great experience. A few points of for not checking belts and upright seats for landing but other than that great!"
"__label__positive  I really appreciated the Air France. They were punctual, the flight attendants were amazing, polite & humble. Respond when needed. The food was good & the announcement was clear. When I was using online check in to get boarding pass, it was really perfect & I could easily use the check in & the boarding pass process with my cellphone, so there was no need of looking or searching for a laptop in the hotel where I stayed. I really recommend Air France for travel."
"__label__positive  Great all round experience once in the air. On the ground is a different story! The good experience was really down to a fabulous crew. Very professional and charming. The food & beverages was really good. It seems like out of CDG the on board experience has really picked up since I last flew AF out of CDG just prior to covid. Great selections and quality along with awesome presentation. The 787 is really great for long haul. Good seats, good entertainment, quiet cabin and good amenities. Arrived in DTW approx 45 mins ahead of schedule. The bad part is the ground service. I'm sure the rush to travel now restrictions are being eased does not help, but at both LIS and CDG the boarding process is pandemonium. No-one seems to understand zoned boarding, so you literally have to fight your way through throngs of people to board at your allotted time. The paperwork for Covid related info at CDG was never addressed over the PA, but there was a table (without pens) and some papers that should be filled out, but no-one working the gate said anything until you were scanning your BP with the gate agent, so many people would then retreat back to the table and back through the line of passengers waiting to board. To cap all this, a PAX traveling with her 7 YO son was denied boarding and caused a major commotion for about 20 mins as she had been misinformed about her sons test. OK maybe this isn't on Air France, but from what she screamed to the security agents would suggest she had been given the wrong info by Air France the previous day when she was denied boarding because she didn't have the correct test to travel to USA. After getting the required test she arrived at the gate of my flight only to be denied because her son had not been tested. I know this is 100% on the passenger, but she had been misinformed about this requirement by AF the previous day in regards to her son, so certainly have some sympathy for her. Overall it added enormously to the chaos and CDG is not best equipped to have an entire widebody's load of PAX jostling and not observing any kind of distancing. Apart from the poor ground service the only negative thing while in the air was the terrible wifi. Such slow speeds even emailing was futile and considering I paid to be connected the entire flight, I couldn't really work on anything."
"__label__positive  Best airline in Russia! Very nice staff, comfortable seats (I don't ask much, I mean this is coming from a girl who drives tanks), good service and power supplies, anything you can possibly ask for, enough room for my single bag, and even more room. Great service, good crew, wonderful meals, and so much more!! Ground service, I was pushed around a lot, but that isn't the staffs' fault. I don't remember turning on my in-flight entertainment system, I was too busy playing World of Tanks Blitz with the incredible WiFi."
"__label__positive  I was very impressed with the staff. Many thanks to the Aeroflot representative Nina at Larnaca, who was extremely professional, friendly and genuinely caring for her passengers. The cabin crew were outstanding as well, especially the flight attendant Asiya and the purser Irina. They did everything to make people onboard happy."
"__label__positive London to Moscow on brand new A350-900. I must say I’ve experienced one of the best business class hard products in the world. Amazing suits with doors, featuring a huge and easy to navigate IFE screen with lots of movies and music, super comfortable lie-flat seat, lots of storage space, and great touches, such as a personal wardrobe, and a locker with a mirror. Staff were amazing, food was good (although I think Aeroflot still has a room for improvement here, especially if it wants to become a 5 star airline), and ground service was quick and efficient. All in all, Aeroflot’s A350 is definitely above and beyond any competition from other European carriers."
"__label__positive  London to Moscow on Aeroflot B773. I always wanted to try out their Comfort Class, and had an opportunity this time. I must say that the soft product is amazing. Excellent business class quality meals (must say, even better than in business class), highly professional, efficient and super friendly crew, good ground experience in London (many Aeroflot representatives at Heathrow, guiding and informing passengers at check in and near boarding). My big complaint though was the shell seat, which was hard to sit on, had really poor recline, and it’s footrest was quite useless. Otherwise, i loved the product and found it much more worthy in value than Aeroflot’s average European business class."
__label__positive  Aeroflot refunded fully the ticket costs by clicking only only button. The process was easy and fast. My flight was not cancelled it’s just due to the new quarantine rules in the country of arrival I had to cancel the ticket. I was surprised and please to see how easy and fast the refund process is. Other airlines offer vouchers or refund only 30% of the ticket price whereas Aeroflot did it  on their website and refunded the full fare paid. I am very pleased with the service and would be happy to book again.
"__label__positive  Lyon to Moscow via Delhi. Fantastic customer services. I had a cancelled flight with another operator so missed my long haul, called the free helpline and the service was excellent and every easily resolved. I have flown a few times with Aeroflot and have always been very surprised at how good and easy the customer services are. Thankyou"
"__label__positive  Bucharest to Moscow. My first time ever with Aeroflot and thoroughly enjoyed it. I can honestly say some of the best cabin service I have received anywhere. Cabin staff were friendly and warm and accommodated all requests and did everything with confidence and style. All were also immaculately attired and turned out. For a three hour flight, not overly long, they got in three services, a food run, then tea and coffee and duty free and made it look easy. I also loved the Sukhoi Superjet (SSJ100) despite all the stories about it. I chose to fly it deliberately, as I wanted to see for myself what it was like. Great little regional commuter. I found it very comfortable inside with ample leg room and a rear toilet that was huge - larger than on some big wide bodies. Plane was also very clean inside. No IFE but to be expected on short haul regional commutes and didn't phase me and didn't expect any. So my overall experience with Aeroflot from Bucharest to Moscow return, was outstanding and enjoyable and I can't think of anything to mark down. I will be flying with them again and will try a longer haul on a different aircraft to see how it compares. Based on two flights though, I would recommend them highly."
"__label__positive Ljubljana to Moscow. Both flights on time. Cabin nice and fresh, seating much better than average in economy. To my surprise, Aeroflot introduced hot meals also for flights of less than 3 hours. Menu card for lunch with 2 options and in return for breakfast with 3, meals nice and tasty. Cabin crews pleasant and working hard. Overall, great flights. The only problem is that they do not send relevant information to passengers, e.g. 24 hours before departure the departure terminal in the mail from Aeroflot was F, which was wrong, the departure terminal was actually D, a very different one far away. Still, when it comes to economy product Aeroflot and Turkish stand out from the rest in Europe."
"__label__positive  London to Dubai via Moscow. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the service provided from staff when buying our ticket at Heathrow Terminal 4. The service is second to none. When we got to Dubai was brilliant as per your advice, we are welcomed from the immigration and no trouble at all. We cannot thank you enough and staff at Heathrow are an assets to Aeroflot. Definitely will visit Moscow next time with your company!"
"__label__positive ✅ Trip Verified |  Warsaw to Moscow return. Standard in economy class is better than in LH, or LOT. We got a tasty sandwich, apple, and choco wafel. For drink, selection of juices, tea & coffee were served, in Moscow free newspapers and magazines. The aircraft was extremely clean. Flight attendants were very polite and helpful and very well organized however, the aircraft was near full. Ground service in Moscow is organized better than in e.g. CDG, or Lyon. In all airports you have to wait in the lines for passport control, it usually takes about 20 - 30 minutes, but in WAW was 20 also. From the airport is a very comfortable train to the center."
"__label__positive  Paris to Phuket via Moscow, economy class, Dec 4th 2019. Frequent Flyer with Aeroflot for nearly 3 years now, all I can say is that I'm fully satisfied with them. Swift priority check-in and security check in Paris via dedicated lanes for Frequent Flyers. Lounge access. Fly Attendants very welcoming, helpful and genuine. Space + seat (front row) and economy seat with good width (18') and pitch (32') - Aeroflot is one of the very few Airlines to still give 18 inches width (most nowadays give 17"" or less). Moscow Airport is quite good, the various lounges for Frequent Flyers / business passengers are really excellent. Arrived on time and relaxed to Phuket. Had only once in 3 years a delayed luggage (was delivered 48 hours latter to my door in Paris, free of charge to me). Overall an excellent Airline and I strongly recommend Aeroflot."
"__label__positive  I was flying from Prague to Cairo via Moscow, the staff are professional and nice, good value for money, food was nice , cabin was clean, Aeroflot improved a lot."
"__label__positive  The Flight Attendants in business class were courteous, helpful, and professional. They made sure I was comfortable. In addition, the chef prepared delectable meals and a variety of beverages were available. My overall experience was excellent."
__label__positive  Excellent service on board and amazing catering. They are working hard to improve their service. The culture of serving tea is amazing.
"__label__positive  The flight was good. In all together the cabin crew was very nice, we arrived early and there was no delay in our trip. I found the seats a little bit uncomfortable, but thats acceptable for a low cost airline. The foods and drinks were a little too expensive."
__label__positive  I flew with Wizz Air yesterday (19/03/22) and the crew were amazing. I was feeling anxious about flying and the whole crew was so supportive and helped me a lot. They were making sure during the whole flight that I was feeling okay and checking up on me. Thank you all so much!
"__label__positive  Paid £17.99 for a flight to Greece. Saw all of the horrible reviews and expected the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised. The flight departed on time, cabin was clean, crew were friendly and attentive. Seats weren’t the most comfortable, and I think anything more than 3 hours might be quite painful. Crew not pushy with inflight sales like on Ryanair which was nice to see. Would fly again, maybe I got lucky, but nothing wrong with my experience with Wizz."
"__label__positive  Speedy boarding followed. Spacious cabin, quite good legroom for 6’2”. Friendly cabin crew. Clean seat/cabin, selection of snacks. We’d booked one aisle seat and one window seat, hoping that we’d get the row, however someone came along and sat on our row - not the airlines fault. It would be good if you were given a cleaning wipe and small bottle of water to clean down your table and seat before departure."
"__label__negative  Disgusting service, they wouldn't let me on the plane without paper PCR even though it says electronic is fine online! A sweetheart of lady called Cvijeta printed it for me last second. That woman should get a medal."
"__label__negative  My issue with Air France is that I bought a No fee change ticket and since trying to change my return ticket which is on the 8th May 2022 I have got nothing but the run around. As for a customer service it is non existent. I am in Peru and cannot get my flight from Costa Rica on that date and I did manage to chat with some form of humanoid/robot on their chat line via facebook, for 6 days messaging back and forth with no actual assistance whatsoever. Every time I suggested a flight or date I could exchange my ticket for they told me I could not do it. There is no customer service, no one to speak to or even email, and once they have your money you are hung out to dry. Hence they have taken £612 for a flight that is worth £300 due to the fact that they will not not honour their no fee change policy. I am not asking for a refund but to exchange my ticket for another flight. I have already stated that I am prepared to pay extra if it is a flight that is more expensive. "

"__label__negative  My wife, myself and our three daughters age 3,5&9 flying back to uk from Faro. My youngest daughter had an accident in the departure lounge and we ended up missing the 20 minute deadline to board the plane by 3 mins. The irony being we’d been sat in the departure lounge waiting for the flight to board for over 30 mins. There was no way they would let us on the plane and they ceremoniously told us this in front of 300 people flying on the adjacent flight. My wife and eldest daughter in tears. My youngest not sure what’s going on. All in all 10 hours later we got back to the UK, Stansted instead of Birmingham. We hired a car at 1am in the morning and drove home to Gloucestershire. I drove to collect my car from Birmingham airport the next day. £900 mistake overall. Ryanair charged us £500 of that just to adjust the 5 tickets regardless of age. The one saving grace was the good will of the passengers that moved their seats to help us sit together. My distain for this airline can only be described in words I can’t possibly write in this review."
"__label__negative  I purchased my ticket over 2 weeks ago. They cancelled my flight which is understandable, but when I tried to contact their customer service line, I waited for over 45mins on the line without an answer 3 times within 2 days. Finally, on the final attempt, my call was answered at 51mins waiting time. I was relieved, finally, I could speak to a human being and ask for help to my situation. The customer service rep literally said, ""sorry there is nothing we can do, good bye"" and preceded to hang up on me."
"__label__negative  Vilnius to Tokyo via Moscow in January 2020 was a nightmare because my luggage was damaged and I spent about a month contacting them for compensation and I've got none. Nonetheless, customer support at Moscow airport doesn't care. While people were rushing and had urgent questions, all 3 women at the counter just put a ""break 15min"" sign and left. I had a ticket back to Lithuania on June 6th from Tokyo, through Moscow. I knew that the flight will be canceled because Lithuania embassy information was 100% sure that borders will be closed for traveling from Moscow until July 1st. However, when I called airline, they said that it's not true, and they are not sure about that, I still canceled my flight, because I always buy flights with cancelation option. (Flight was officially canceled just a couple days before the departure). Their policy says that return takes around 10 working days. Its been a month and all they say is Wait. Even customer support on the phone is poorly mannered. I understand that this epidemic time is very bad for airlines, but it is not a customer problem. "
"__label__negative  I had to pay extra 40 euro at airport for check in. I tried to check in online in advance for free as their site promises that it works, but I couldn't finish my check in because free seats were finished. I wanted to buy a seat for to finish the check in, but even then I couldn't finish the check in because of some technical errors of their site. In reality this is how they work, they block you for finishing the online check in for free for to take more money from you at airport. Many other passengers from that flight had the same problem. I don't recommend Wizz Air, they attract people with cheap prices, but in reality you pay for all kind of fees and unexpected errors they create. It's better to buy from a honest company who tells you straight how much it costs without scamming you and deceived you. Reading other people's reviews I see that Wizz Air is a very unreliable company. Some people have much more terrible experience with them."
"__label__negative  On return leg (KRK to MUC to BOS), scheduled to leave KRK at 13.20 local time. Was told pilot didn't want to fly because of weather conditions (low clouds) but other aircraft departing no problem. Checked Flightaware.com which showed no arrival delays in MUC. No other information given. Was told I would not make the MUC to BOS flight so they canceled my whole itinerary and re-booked my travel to the next day. Was given hotel and meal voucher. Next day, departed KRK 20 minutes late and arrived MUC 20 minutes late. Only had an hour to transfer between terminal 2 and remote terminal in MUC. Ridiculous security screening just to get to the departure gate. My bags were searched 3 times at 3 check points. Woman in front of me made the flight. I got there 5 minutes later and they had closed the doors and refused to allow me on. I am sitting here in MUC as I write this looking at my plane still sitting at the departure gate nearly an hour after the scheduled departure time and I am furious. No excuse to strand me in MUC especially since the plane is departing late anyways."
"__label__negative  They have positively reviewed my claim for ticket refund 3 months ago, but I still have to see my money back! I am inside of EU, so theoretically they have 7 days to make the refund. There is no way to contact them other than by phone (there are no online forms for this case) but the representatives have misinformed me several times without me having any proof of it, so I strongly advise to not use this point of contact. "
"__label__negative  The passenger behind refused to wear mask for entire flight. Their actions endangered everyone on the flight, passengers, attendants and pilots. The staff repeatedly told the passenger follow health guidelines and they refused. Do not fly with company. Your personal health and safe is not a priority with this company. This company obviously puts profits before the health and welfare of its staff and clients. I will never fly with this airline. Why, we’re passenger aloud to Jeopardize the health of the flight? Why were the authorities not informed, and had these passengers charged and fined? These passengers should be put on the do not fly list and never allowed to fly with Ryanair again. The health and welfare of passenger should be the first priority and it obviously that did not happen. Word of caution, choose any other airline but this one."
__label__negative  I bought my tickets for travel in April 2020 for my friend and I and unfortunately because of the Covid-19 my flight was cancelled. I’ve subscribe for a refund and 5 months later I still didn’t get news of it. I’ve send messages and answers was useless. So I’ve called the center the lady on the phone didn’t seem to understand what’s going on and she told me that I can’t do a refund anymore I need to do voucher. So I’ve decided to do my voucher and the website didn’t work. So I’ve sand email to the center again nd this afternoon I’ve tried the voucher with my friend name and she got her voucher back but you can only use 15% on it so how many flight I need to do to have my £800 back?. And with my name I can’t have my voucher I don’t know why for my ticket that put error.  I’ve been fighting during almost 10 months to have my refund. It shouldn’t take that time and that energy to have the money you said you’d pay me back. 
__label__negative  Worst experience. So many hidden fees. Had to pay expensive fines for problems that was not my mistake. Rude staff and not comfortable flight.
"__label__negative  I needed to check in online two different Bookings. I used the WIZZ APP. By one of the bookings, it was ok. By the second booking, I went all through the check in and I had a problem with the Seats Payment. The WIZZ App didn't allow me to start again and pay for the seats. I even received an e-mail about the seats to pay. When I got at the Airport, they said that I didn't do the check in and I needed to pay 40 dollars for each person. I was very upset, because I did the check in in the APP, I just had problem with the Seats and the App could not retrieve my booking. They ask us to do check in online, the App did not work well and I paid the price. I wrote a complain to the WIZZ Air, but they didn't take serious. They said that it was my fault, that I did wrong. Not recommend Wizz Air. If they ask for Check in Online, they need to offer a good App."
"__label__negative EasyJet lost my baggage and couldn't care less. After 48 hours they only sent one email saying ""sorry for any inconvenience"", but no updates to where my luggage is or when I will get it back. Should I go to the shop and buy a new wardrobe? There is no way of contacting them, no numbers are manned."
"__label__negative  Easyjet state on their website that ‘all passengers can carry on cabin luggage 45cmx36cmx20cm. I bought a case with these measurements (including wheels and handle) but was stopped at the gate in Stansted, asked to put my case in the size checker, and was charged to put the case in the hold. When I challenged the sizing I was rudely dismissed and was told this size was for speedy boarding passengers only. I checked the size of the case once again when I returned home and it was exactly as stated on Easyjet website."
"__label__negative  I flew with Wizz Air on 20/08/21 and I had problem right from the minute i booked my ticket, after approval of my purchased ticket I received notice that I have underpaid my ticket by £24 I then called the call centre twice - the first time I was on hold for 50 minutes and nobody answered, second time 1 hour and still nobody answered. Finally I managed to pay the outstanding £24 ,a few days later I wanted to download my boarding ticket i then received info that I couldn’t download my boarding pass because I was over £12 then realised I was charged £12 for spoilage fees due to my original purchase being underpaid without my knowing. The day of my flight I was still unable to check in which meant I had to arrive at the airport 5 hours before my flight, finally managed to check in after 2 hours because staff didn’t know how to help I got sent to 5 different staff members. I had the exact same problem flying back."
"__label__negative Staff have absolutely no idea what they are doing. Inconsistencies in policy, giving inconsistent and inaccurate information leading to more costs. A money making scheme to exploit the customer. Take your business to a reputable company instead."
"__label__negative  Problem right from the minute i booked the tickets with the non user friendly website. Complicated I believe on purpose. In order to make booking changes, the site prompts you to make o phone call, selecting country and language, charging you at a very expensive rate ending up to an operator speaking only English. Finally the choice given to change the dates of traveling was costing more than the original coast of the ticket. No refund and no credit note. The reservation has been done and paid by me, on behalf of my relatives leaving in Greece. They didn't travel due to Covid -19 restrictions set by the Greek government during that period due to the fact that they are Health Civil Servants."
"__label__negative  Worst airline ever, I have travelled with this airline several times and what applies to a city doesn’t apply to another. It’s supposed to be considered a low cost airline but they look for every possible way to charge you, I had no trouble getting my suitcase on the flight in Madrid airport but they made me pay for it the Canary Islands, I arrived 2 minutes late for boarding today’s flight (28 minutes still for take off), a lady was just in front of me, they let her pass and didn’t let me, said they had already closed. 2 ladies stated that all flights close their doors 30 minutes before departure when we all know that’s a lie. They start boarding 30 minutes before departure. They were very rude and should not work in customer service, it is not meant for everyone. "
"__label__negative  Coming back from Corfu was a nightmare. I am not moaning about our flight being cancelled because that may have been out of Ryanair's hands but the fact that they did not help with anything after we were told that the flight was cancelled is unbelievable! We were told to book our own flights and find accommodation. We were offered no care packages which are promised if your flight was delayed, in fact we were offered no help at all. We tried all night to talk to Ryanair through their app which was a total waste of time because we were never connected. We didn't have any children with us but many people did and their accommodation and flights must of been astronomical to rebook. I can not believe how they just dismissed us from their minds. I will think twice before using them again and I will definitely not recommend them to anyone"
"__label__negative I had an extremely negative experience with Wizz Air yesterday while attempting to fly to Reykjavik. First, I received my boarding pass on my phone prior to arrival at the airport and didn't need to check any baggage, so I went straight through security and into the airport. Budapest airport doesn't announce the gate for your flight until about 30 minutes prior to check-in closing, so I waited around for a while. Finally, my gate information appears and I went straight to my gate to check in (almost the first one in line). Right away, I am asked for my covid documentation which I have in the form of the EU Digital CovidPass, which is accepted in Iceland and is what I obtained especially for this trip (I'm am American citizen and was fully vaccinated in America, which makes this a lengthy process). The girl at check in says that it is not sufficient and I will also need a negative covid test to travel. First of all! I checked the travel restrictions for Iceland several times prior to my journey and read in numerous places that a test was not necessary. ""Can you visit Iceland? Yes. All travelers – regardless of origin – are welcome to visit Iceland if they can show either a certificate of full vaccination against COVID, or a certificate of previous COVID infection."" - Icelandair I assume, therefore, that with my EU residence permit and EU Digital CovidPass, that I would be OK for travel. Second of all, neither that service that I booked through (Kiwi) or my airline (Wizz) provided any information about what documents I would need until the second I arrived at the gate, only 30 minutes before the closing of check-in. Finally, almost everyone who I interacted with was rude, and completely uninterested in helping me find a solution. I could have received a rapid test at Budapest airport in time, or there is a perfectly valid option to receive a test in Iceland and quarantine until the results return. No matter the suggestion I made, the Wizz Air authorities were disrespectful and adamant that I do not board the plane. And I believe its also relevant to add that I'm a 19 year old solo female traveler, for which the thought of missing my flight and being stranded in a foreign country is not particularly pleasant, however I was met with no sympathy from anyone during this experience. Extremely dissatisfied with Wizz customer service and refund policy. Do better. "
"__label__negative  Extremely poor customer service. They want everyone to check in at the kiosk. Done. The kiosk asks me to see a customer service rep. I go to stand in line, the rep guiding everyone asks me to go to the baggage drop off line inspite of me showing him the message. I stand in the baggage drop off line for half hour. They cannot print my boarding pass. Then the rep from the baggage drop line tells me to go to the customer service line. So I go to the line, and lo behold the rep is standing there. After hearing my story and smirking he guides me to the customer service line. So now I stand in line again! For another 30 minutes. "
__label__negative  Messy online checkin in Bogota which didn't allow to upload my vaccination certificate (it did on the outbound route) nor select/change seat. I was able though to change my seat after downloading the LH mobile app. The vaccination cert was requested / checked by 3 different staff at bag dropoff and boarding. Horrible food served  with overcooked vegetarian pasta served for mains on both outbound and inbound flights. IFE was mediocre with a very poor selection of films. The staff were brusque. Seat comfort poor. Used LH pre pandemic and the experience was much better.
"__label__negative  The worst flight I have taken in my 50 years of travel. The Crew were abrasive and disengaging, clearly service was not a priority. If you asked a question you received a surly blunt response. The aircraft was  extremely uncomfortable and offered old in-flight entertainment. The headsets we received needed to be manipulated to accommodate this older system. The food provided was pathetic - macaroni and cheese for Economy class.  It turned out to be overcooked white pasta with processed Parmesan cheese thrown in for good measure. The salad was at least real. The breakfast was a sugar cake muffin with three small pieces of pineapple chunks. When I asked if I had received the meal as perhaps this was for children, I was told no that was the economy class meal. I will not fly Lufthansa again and have gone out of my way to tell many of my colleagues family and friends about this horrendous experience."
"__label__negative  Athens to Moscow. Rude customer service to me, and for my bag being 3cm too large, they made me check my bag and pay 100€. "
"__label__negative  Ryanair does not have any respect for the customers and are just a money seeking airline. They do not see the mistakes of their own, but of the customers only. From check-in to security check up until getting on the flight it was full of chaos. Although we had plenty of time left, we had to be in a hurry but at the end we, us ourselves, found out that the plane was delayed. They did not make a single announcement about the delay, or sorry for the inconvenience. All they did was sit and do nothing. Thanks for ruining my trip to London. They charge you 3 euros for a bottle of water. Due to the run I had to make to the gate, because they had their problem, I needed water, but no! It's Ryanair, they will charge you for every single penny. I hope they fix their problems for other future customers."
"__label__negative  Our flight had to make an emergency landing due to an unwell passenger which was understandable however what happened next made me never want to fly with Lufthansa again. Pilot said we could either rebook onto another flight or stay in a hotel while another flight is arranged for us. Upon departing the plane we were approached by a member of staff of Ankara airport who had no ties to Lufthansa. She provided a phone number to get in contact with Lufthansa should we want to rearrange a flight, this number did not work. After calling multiple Lufthansa numbers we were told different lies on every attempt as to why they couldn't rebook us onto a flight leaving in 2 hours. The best one was that our baggage hadn't been released by the airport when we in fact had the baggage in our hands. On 2 occasions the member of staff  we were speaking to just stopped replying to any questions or queries and seemed to have hung up. This all resulted in a substantial phone bill and a missed days work. After contacting them to offer the opportunity to reimburse the said phone bill as a good will gesture and reinvest some faith in this airline I was accused of demanding compensation. "
"__label__negative  I took the first half of a roundrip flight to Sofia from Chicago and then got a credit for the return flight. It took several phone calls to get the credit because they at first said it wouldn't be possible to change the flight, then they said it wasn't possible to get a credit etc. When I called to rebook (booking with a credit on their website is impossible, also I can't even select my City from a dropdown list of hundreds of cities in my state. The website and the android app are unusable for anything.) They made a new reservation and asked me to call back 12 hours later to pay for the ticket. I called and the new reservation I just made was canceled. I took another 30 minutes on the phone booking yet another reservation, they said a Turkish Airlines rep would call me back to take payment. They never called. I called back and tried to pay for the reservation and again they said it was cancelled. This company is evil. They are not just incompetent, they are trying to stall and lie to extract more money from you while wasting hours of your time on the phone."
"__label__negative  My wife was supposed to fly from Sochi to Chisinau, with a change in Istanbul. We bought round trip tickets. Arriving at the check-in desk, she was refused to let on the flight by staff members saying that she did not have proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Although she had. The employee tried to explain to us that the customs service of the Republic of Moldova would not let her pass with these documents. Because of this, we needed to buy new tickets from another airline and with the same documents that we had, we successfully reached Moldova. We contacted the airline several times explaining the situation and providing proof that we were right. But no one even considered our appeal, answering with standard forms. As a result, we were not even able to use return tickets, as we ""didn't show up"" on the first flight. Poor service, I do not recommend!"
"__label__negative  My wife, myself and our three daughters age 3,5&9 flying back to uk from Faro. My youngest daughter had an accident in the departure lounge and we ended up missing the 20 minute deadline to board the plane by 3 mins. The irony being we’d been sat in the departure lounge waiting for the flight to board for over 30 mins. There was no way they would let us on the plane and they ceremoniously told us this in front of 300 people flying on the adjacent flight. My wife and eldest daughter in tears. My youngest not sure what’s going on. All in all 10 hours later we got back to the UK, Stansted instead of Birmingham. We hired a car at 1am in the morning and drove home to Gloucestershire. I drove to collect my car from Birmingham airport the next day. £900 mistake overall. Ryanair charged us £500 of that just to adjust the 5 tickets regardless of age. The one saving grace was the good will of the passengers that moved their seats to help us sit together. My distain for this airline can only be described in words I can’t possibly write in this review."
"__label__negative  Their app is sophisticated and tricky. I had to change flight and did not see that they automatically changed my departure date. Long story short I had to reschedule flight and their ""changing fee"" was basically buying a new flight. Customer service is really bad."
"__label__negative  Amsterdam to Hong Kong via Moscow. 13 days before my departure date, I got a message that my flight was canceled and an alternative flight was offered to me with a departure date which was 1 day earlier than my original flight. Although it was very inconvenient, I agreed on taking the alternative flight. Then 5 days before my flight, I got the message that my alternative flight was full and there was no other option then to cancel my booking with a refund. I was therefore forced to find an alternative flight myself within 5 days.  I did manage to find an alternative flight but it cost me way much more than what I originally booked."
"__label__negative  Athens to Moscow. A320 economy seats of a new type, very thin, hard. Sitting on these is not convenient. The choice of food was not great. Stewardesses were not very welcoming to me."
