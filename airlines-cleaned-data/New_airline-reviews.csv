0,ryanair,"Not Verified |  Do not fly Ryanair if you have children! Their website states you are allowed a carry on baby changing bag - yet staff wanted to put my baby’s milk / nappies etc in the hold. I also paid priority boarding to allow me to take on my fold up buggy into the cabin but I was refused this and threatened to be thrown off the flight. My changing bag and buggy were both within restrictions given on Ryanair’s website. Not only that, but when I disputed this, the air crew then refused to serve myself, my 10 month old baby, 2 year old and 3 year old for the entire 4 hour flight. They would not even take our rubbish. I was flying solo with my 3 children and they made our experience so stressful. They are unhelpful, with no understanding or compassion for their passengers. Other passengers were also saying how ridiculous it was given that I had paid for the baggage and I was flying solo.

After few seconds I was billed and I decide that it was mistake and wait that this withdrawal will cancel. But it was not happened. Than, i try to place booking again and it was success. I ask my bank about first withdrawal, why it was not canceled and they ask me to contact with Ryanair support. I did this and it turned out that in fact in the first case the reservation was placed!

2,ryanair,"✅ Trip Verified |  Terrible customer service and non-existent communication As a US resident, I had the bad experience of being stuck in isolation in Italy because of covid. As a consequence, I was unable to make it for my Ryanair flights within Italy. I tried to reach out to the company several time to inform them about my situation. After several attempts using some kind of useless robot on their website and talking to representatives on the phone, they don't seem to have or want to put in place any customer-friendly measures in this already stressful situation.

We weren't allowed to put our backpacks in the overhead storage bins due to corona but it's fine for hand suitcases to go in there and to sit in a seat that's dirty with dirty marks on the window and the side of the window. We had a return flight and sat in the same plane going to Italy and back again to Finland.. Same dirt as when we flew the first time. There's also no space for you to put your dirt in the front seat and the trays are at a angle that whatever you put on there slides down and the seats are so upright you can't sleep.,"""Plane is very dirty""",3,Finland,25th March 2022,no
5,ryanair,"✅ Trip Verified |  The last time I am ever going to fly with them. When arriving at the airport for check in, there was only one member of staff on the relevant desks and so a lengthy wait was needed before we got to speak to them. By the time we did speak with them, she informed us that we had just missed the check in period and each ticket was now to be charged £55 in order to check in. The total of £110 was as expensive as the actual flight tickets, if not more. The late check in was primarily due to the understaffing at the Ryanair counter at Stansted and not to any poor time keeping or organisation on our part. After reluctantly paying this extortionate fee (what other choice did we have?), we then proceeded through security and on to our gate. Once we boarded the plane however, there was than a 1 hr 45 min delay to our flight where we sat on the tarmac and waited. Having been charged £110 just moments earlier for being late and then being delayed for almost 2 hours really angered me. The late check in fee was entirely unnecessary and immensely overpriced in the first place, but what with our flight being delayed, it then also proved to be completely redundant. It seems that I was deemed late and charged, but they can be four or five times as late as I was deemed to be and get away with it.","""The last time I am ever going to fly with them""",1,United Kingdom,25th March 2022,no
6,ryanair,Not Verified |  We were travelling with our 1yr old baby. We could not check-in online for some reason. We arrived at the airport 2h10 before but time to queue (very long queue) we arrive at the desk 1h30 before the flight and then we had to pay 110 euros for manual check-in (for what is this 55 euros fees I don't know but does not seems fair). Then we queue (again very long queue at the security check-in) and we run to get to the gate. There someone says we only have a FFP2 masks and need a FFP3 mask. Anyway we just want to get on the flight so we go to buy some FFP3 masks at the nearby shop (which actually are FFP2 but much more thick). We are then allowed to enter the flight and noticed that all of the Ryanair employees on board have a simple mask (same as we had before we were refused). Flight was okay even though the seats are really uncomfortable. Thank god it was only 1h30 flight. Anyway last time I fly with them.

7,ryanair,"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife, myself and our three daughters age 3,5&9 flying back to uk from Faro. My youngest daughter had an accident in the departure lounge and we ended up missing the 20 minute deadline to board the plane by 3 mins. The irony being we’d been sat in the departure lounge waiting for the flight to board for over 30 mins. There was no way they would let us on the plane and they ceremoniously told us this in front of 300 people flying on the adjacent flight. My wife and eldest daughter in tears. My youngest not sure what’s going on. All in all 10 hours later we got back to the UK, Stansted instead of Birmingham. We hired a car at 1am in the morning and drove home to Gloucestershire. I drove to collect my car from Birmingham airport the next day. £900 mistake overall. Ryanair charged us £500 of that just to adjust the 5 tickets regardless of age.

8,ryanair,"✅ Trip Verified | Regular Ryanair customer. Flew back from Alicante on Friday 18 th March 2022 into Shannon. Perfect flight and landed 15 minutes early. But wanted to commend a few things. The cabin crew were excellent, very professional. The landing was so smooth I didn’t realise we where on the ground. But I do wish to single out the senior flight attendant. I was carrying some duty free as well as my 10 kg case which was heavy. The steps off the plane were steep which normally I’ll cope with. But I asked this young man if I could leave my case till I get down the steps and then come back up and get it. Not at all he said I’ll take down for you. He was a gentleman. I thanked him and he said it was his pleasure. One final thought it was the first time I heard senior cabin crew thank his colleagues for their help and hard work during flight. Nice touch I thought.

9,ryanair,"✅ Trip Verified | This was the first time I have flown with Ryanair for years, after previous bad experiences, and I only flew as it was part of a package deal. It’s not that much cheaper than other airlines, which would give a better experience. The boarding process was the worst I have ever experienced. We were second in the priority queue and ended up, passing through the gate and waiting at the bottom steps waiting for a bus for ages, then we were one of the first to board the bus. We then had to wait on the bus at the bottom of the aircraft for ages, and when we got off the bus, surprise surprise we were now much further from the front. This is Ryanair priority boarding. Pretty much everyone on the flight had priority boarding, but it only gets you priority onto the bus. This is not really priority. The staff were very good, the food offerings were poor, and the seat is bolt upright, with no adjustment, and no storage. The seat is only really suitable for an hour or two flight, not four hour’s. We were at the furthest possible gate in Tenerife, and arrived into the furthest possible gate in Dublin. This is typical of Ryanair.

10,ryanair,"Not Verified |  Worst customer service experience I have ever had. We arrived an hour and a half before departure and went to check in. Ryanair only had two employees. One member of my company and I were denied our COVID certification due to a difference in Italian rules we were unaware of, which was fair, except we were leaving the country to go to the UK where we were in line with the rules. Regardless the staff sent us to the basement to buy a COVID rapid test. Within 20 minutes we were upstairs again with our results, but the two employees had closed the check in counter, after they had told us to run downstairs to get a test and then come back for our boarding passes. We couldn’t get our passes online because it directed us to the ticket counter, but the ticket counter had stranded us. The rest of our party had headed through security while we got our tests and approached the Ryanair staff on that side and told them our dilemma. They told us to obtain our boarding passes online, which we couldn’t do because it directed us to the ticket counter. They told us we had to book new flights because no one was at the check in counter. We were early enough we would have made the flight had someone been at the check in counter to simply print our passes (as we had checked in online). Our party members talking with the employees at the gate talked with them for 50 minutes trying to get them to send someone to log in but they refused. During that conversation we informed the Ryanair representatives that one of the stranded members was prone to seizures and was out of their medication (which was in England. They simply hadn’t brought extra) and needed to be on the flight to get her medication. The staff was unresponsive, with the manager also refusing to get our passes and when told about the seizure situation was told that if they seized “we would have to take them to a hospital”. After no help those of us that were stranded found a hotel and arrived there before the flight took of, as it departed 50 minutes after the scheduled departure time. Absolutely the worst experience.

Beware of the latest scam - 3rd party services booked on the Ryanair website: I was flying from London to Malaga and, when I purchased extra hold luggage the day before I flew, I decided to, at the same time, also buy a ticket for National Express from Victoria coach station to Stansted airport. I did so and paid one amount on my credit card, but I received no confirmation of the National Express booking, so I called NE and they had no record of my booking or payment. I did so again the next morning - still no record, so I had to buy the ticket again at a higher price. I tried to call Ryanair, but could not get through to them, nor had any success with their ""live"" chat. After arriving in Malaga I tried to get a refund from Ryanair, whom I had paid, but they said that I needed to get this from NE and that it had nothing to do with them as NE were a third party service provider. All my explanations that I had paid Ryanair and NOT NE were ignored. So I called NE again and they still said that they had no record of the reservation or payment, so I had to make a claim against my credit card company for a refund. All this took several hours of my time and was incredibly stressful. It was a relatively small amount, but I was incensed by Ryanair's approach and determined to get my money back. They are truly shocking in their customer service.  Only fly with them if there is NO alternative, even if other airlines are more expensive. Only buy the most basic/cheapest ticket and only upgrade or buy extras (seat choice, hold luggage, food, etc) as late as possible and just before your flight - in case there is a change of plan or cancellation, then your refund amount is much lower. Never purchase 3rd party services from their website - car rental, coach travel, hotels, etc. If there is a problem then they will screw you.

25,ryanair,"✅ Trip Verified | There is no word in the English language that can fully describe how bad this airline is. I’ve had my shares of bad experience with Ryanair but always thought “Well, my bad I should have been more prepared I guess” or “they are probably having a bad day, cut them some slack” etc. But if you’re going to be aggressive and verbally abusive to two senior travelers, then we’re going to have a real problem. Even more if the seniors in question are my parents who have a limited knowledge of English. My parents came to visit us this weekend. They arrived in London fully prepared, vaccinated, passports, forms, VeriFly app literally everything that was required and asked of them. They flew in with BA at Heathrow and everything went smoothly (take some notes Stansted!). Then we prepared their return journey and they made sure to book 2 handbags (that’s how it works now you have to pay for handbags too). So, prior to the trip they booked two ‘less than 10 kg handbags’ on the agency’s website which gave them also the right to priority board (something they were not aware of). They actually waited and queued until it was time to board and once in front of the person at the desk were asked to pay £90 for the two bags. My dad tried to explain he already paid for it, but she didn’t want to hear it, she laughed to their faces because they tried to explain themselves with the few English words they know, and then she realized that my dad speaks Spanish (apparently, she did too) so they managed to understand each other to some extent. She lost patience and told my parents it was either they paid for the bags, or they had to leave them behind. Scared and tired by the situation they decided to pay and after they got the confirmation and the sticky tag on their bags asked if they could get an invoice or receipt. The lady said she didn’t have it and that they will receive it by email. However never confirmed it with my dad and asked them to quickly move towards the plane and embark. Then someone - I'm guessing who's a security person - yelled at them in the corridor in English (remember a language they don't understand) and kept screaming and shouting at them for a good minute without thinking they might not be able to understand his language. Literally no patience, no kindness, no respect. My parents managed to connect the dots and gathered that he wanted them to leave the bags outside the plane (remember small handbags less than 10 kg) they pointed a corner to him, and he let out some kind of agreeing grunt. Then once on board they probably were thinking they could finally relax, but no, once again someone with a lot of empathy and sympathy decided otherwise. The hostess that day kept asking my mum to remove her jacket, and put it up in the overhead bin, then underneath the seat, then finally take it back and put it on her knees because it wasn’t right, and every 5 minutes came back to check if she was ""cooperating"" because she also asked my mum to remove her scarf and for some reason it needed to be left with the jacket. What is wrong in your head? When a lady of a certain age is cold, you pressure her into removing her clothes? First, I don’t get what the security hazard is with a scarf. Second, it’s literally freezing outside, and we know how cold it can be inside the plane before take-off, also ever heard of covid. I mean come on.

37,ryanair,"✅ Trip Verified | Our flight from Crete to Athens started off with online check-in issues. We followed the prompts, but there was no option for check in, only to cancel or change flight. We even watched a video but never was presented with a check in option on the mobile website. When we arrived at the airport, we spoke to one of the employees at the bag check line, and explained to her our issue with online check in. She offered no help or advice, only said there is nothing for her to do and that we must pay €55 each to print our tickets or we could speak to her coworker at a Skyserv help desk. We proceeded to the alternate employee at the Skyserv booth and once again explained our troubles with online check in. We even showed her the step by step process in which we tried to check in on our mobile phone. She started to raise her voice and said “I don’t know why you’re the only people having an issue. Other customers don’t have this issue. It’s clearly something you did wrong!” Instead of providing us with actual help and presenting a fix to the issue that we physically showed her on the phone, she was dismissive, blaming us, and outright rude. When we wished to escalate the matter, she refused to tell us her name and began acting even more erratic. She stated that “Ryanair will know who I am and I don’t have to give you any information.” At this point we were forced into making one of two decisions - miss our flight or pay €55 for each boarding pass. Extremely unsatisfied with the lack of help, we returned to the bag check desk, and decided to go ahead with the payment. At our second interaction with the bag check staff, we were informed that the price per boarding pass is now €62.50! We showed them the Ryanair email that said it was €55 and explained to said staff that she told us ten minutes prior that it was a €55 fee. The employee told us to look at her screen if we have an issue, because that’s what it says and she could give no explanation for the discrepancy in Ryanair email or what we were previously told. At this point we were uncomfortably coerced into choosing to either miss our flight or pay this new arbitrary price that no employee could give an explanation for. No one can explain to us why we were unable to check in online and no one can explain to us why there was an increase in price after this entire debacle. Fast forward two months after this incident and multiple complaints to Ryanair, they finally responded with again no resolution. A representative from Ryanair emailed stating, ""At first, I would like to express our sympathy regarding the circumstances resulting in you being unable to have done the check-in online. However, if a customer does not manage to check-in online then an airport check-in fee of €55/£55 per person is applied."" This acknowledges our inability to check-in, but somehow still place the blame on the customer. When questioned about why we were arbitrary told to pay €62.50 by the bag check staff when Ryanair and this representative's email clearly stated €55, another rep responded back with, ""Unfortunately, as per the previous responses you have received, our standpoint remains unaltered that means according to our agreed Terms and Conditions Article 10.1 all monies paid towards Ryanair are non-refundable."" So again no explanation. It really feels like a ""you have to pay whatever amount we tell you or you get to miss your flight"" situation.

Arrived at the gate in good time at stansted and the crew at the gate told me off for arriving when they had only just called final boarding. Told my husband they were lucky they were letting him on the flight. The flight was ok out, until one of the crew shouted at the man next to me whose small washbag had broken and was trying not to drop things out of it as he was putting it in the overhead locker. Arrived with all documentation, getting my PLF form sorted to show the gate on my phone and was asked if I’d had a Covid test (this was Italy now trying to return) all paperwork complete and was told not to bother showing my PLF as needed a Covid test and wasn’t allowed to board. We are fully vaccinated and have our day 2 tests ordered. Still refused boarding, despite saying we didn’t need them but he wouldn’t/couldn’t speak English. Took a taxi (€60) to get a test (€30) & bought tickets @ €270. We don’t need a Covid test, should have been allowed on our flight and as Ciampino airport closes overnight we are being made to sleep in the street.

Boarding was slow and messy requiring passengers to queue to have their documents checked, then queue again to check our tickets, then queue again in the jet bridge. What is the point of assigning boarding groups when all but priority passengers are called to board at the same time? Seats in economy were akin to a budget airline with minimal legroom, no headrest or entertainment. Cabin was not clean, and crew handed out alcohol wipes. On both legs I took with Lufthansa there was no food or drink available, complimentary or paid. This was a 2 hour service right about lunchtime. Almost any other full service airline would have provided some sort of food service. It is already low cost carrier like to only have paid food services.

Over the years I have traveled numerous times on Lufthansa and I’m sad to say that this time around, Lufthansa did not live up to its reputation of being Europe’s 5 star airline. The meal choice was poor (only veggie pasta on both legs) and the service of the crew left much to be desired. It seems like the lack of customer service just gets blamed on Covid. Worst of all was the terrible spacing/leg room in economy class. It is big enough for a 10 year old kid but not for a normal size adult. It really felt like the airline wanted to cramp in more passengers to make up for the losses incurred during the pandemic without any regard to the comfort of passengers. On the second leg of our journey we even wanted to upgrade to premium economy or business class but turns out since the FRA-JHB route is so busy, both flights were fully booked. As a Miles and More member I was deeply disappointed. I usually don’t complain about airlines and I’m not pleased I even had to write this one. However, comparing the passenger comfort and the customer service of Lufthansa to that of the middle eastern airlines, or even other European airlines, it really makes me question whether I should fly Lufthansa ever again.

However the on-ground experience was not as good as the premium economy experience with other airlines especially on the Delhi to Frankfurt leg of the flight. Lufthansa does not have a separate check-in counter for Premium Economy and did not offer priority boarding as well on the Delhi Frankfurt leg but did so on the Frankfurt - Chicago leg which was a bit strange.

I had a long argument with the agent who nearly refused to issue my boarding passes although I had all the necessary documents with me (and no problem at all at immigration in Dubai later). Flight from Berlin to Munich on time, but otherwise nothing to praise about it. Lufthansa has introduced a buy on board service on domestic and European flights, but they didn't offer anything on this flight, so even if I had wanted, I couldn't get a coffee or snack. Munich airport is very easy to transfer, but repeated document checks at the gate resulted in a delayed departure. First time flying in Lufthansa's premium economy, and while I liked the seat comfort and additional space, it's disappointing that the service has been reduced to exactly the same as in regular economy, apart from a tiny glass of juice after boarding. They also cut the nuts or crackers with the first drink round, and they now serve coffee or tea together with the meal. That doesn't make any sense as your coffee will be cold once you have finished the meal. On the other hands, portions are shrinking year by year, so there is quite a chance that the coffee is still warm.

Lufthansa failed utterly in providing the basic of this product. Most of the Lufthansa A320neo aircraft have no WiFi. And there is no other form of entertainment.

The lack of communication from Lufthansa and the lack of service that has followed ever since is beyond belief. I received a message as soon as I landed in Malta on 27.01.2021 that my suitcase had not been loaded on the flight. I checked with Lufthansa at the airport right away and filled the correct report – I was instructed to do nothing more and to call Malta Airport and check the next day and arrange for delivery. The luggage has still not arrived and it is 2 weeks later 09.01.2022. From what I was told by the Lufthansa desk in Malta they tried to communicate and investigate with Vienna with no response. From what I can see on the Lufthansa tracking on their site the baggage was sent on 28.12.2021 from Vienna to Malta, and then for some unknown reason from Malta to Frankfurt - however, Malta Airport is reporting the luggage never even landed in Malta. Since then I have had to contact Lufthansa who claims there is no report even made, I have called Frankfurt Airport, Vienna Airport, and Copenhagen Airport to try and get some assistance, I have been passed around and have to communicate with Central Baggage Services and World Tracker – this is beyond infuriating and also just simply unfair as Lufthansa should be able to at the very least guide me in what to do and see where the error happened.","""this is beyond infuriating""",1,Malta,9th January 2022,no

There was another stewardess who was going round checking everyone's belted up, and noticed a father was struggling to belt up the toddler. She stood beside him on the aisle, hands on her hips and just waited silently. Those were the black sheep, because there were nice cabin crew too, such as another steward who thanked me for pulling up the shades as we were about to land.

118,air-france,"✅ Trip Verified |  First medium-haul experience with Air France. This is part of a connecting flight from LHR-MIA via CDG. Check-in at LHR was swift, thanks to Sky Priority (customers flying Premium Economy get Sky Priority access). Due to COVID, check-in meant extra checks and formalities during check-in. All my documents were verified in less than 20 minutes. I received my onward boarding pass to MIA. This is my first medium-haul trip with Air France. The equipment used on this flight was a 10 year old Boeing 777-300ER. I was among the first passengers to board this full and busy flight. The cabin crew upon boarding were very friendly and warm. The plane was in an immaculate condition and was kept very clean. We left 45 minutes behind schedule due to technicalities and the crew gave regular updates. After take off, the crew sprung into action. They distributed a sanitary kit which consisted of a mask, alcohol surface wipes and hand sanitiser. We were told that unfortunately, amenity kits were not loaded on this flight and the crew were very apologetic. The meal service was swift but was done with care. Lunch served was good in quality but lacking in quantity which is the only downside. The crew were also very proactive with the drinks service. After the main meal service, cabin lights were switched off and were invited to help ourselves to the self-help snack bar which was adequately stocked with drinks and snacks. The second meal service came in a rather chic paper bag which consisted of a warm sandwich, a bread roll, a muffin, a chocolate bar, orange juice and a yoghurt drink. In addition, drinks were served again. For a 9 hour flight, the quality of the meals served was good but lacking in quantity. Air France could perhaps increase their portions when it comes to Premium Economy dining. The seat on this aircraft is Air France's fixed shell seat which mean that rather than reclining, the seat slides forwards so that it does not intrude your personal space. The seat was wide with good cushion padding. The pillow and blanket also appeared to be off higher quality compared to other airlines I've flown with in Premium Economy. The seat also came with a leg rest which was a very good addition. Now, there are a lot of negative reviews of this product but I would say that this seat is adequately comfortable for a TransAtlantic flight. My back did get a little sore from the seat sliding forward but I used the pillow to add some padding. I requested for an extra pillow and was given one without hesitancy. As we were flying during COVID, cabin crew and passenger interaction was very minimal to keep each other safe. However, I noted that the crew were very responsive in meeting the needs of the passengers from what I observed. IFE content was outstanding. There were more than enough new Holywood films available and a couple of French, Western, Asian and Bollywood films. In addition, the IFE offering also had plenty of radio stations and Album selections. In addition, the plan is equipped with an external camera. Air France is nowhere near a perfect carrier as there are things that Air France could do better in terms of its Premium Economy service which in my opinion would be: increasing portion sizes of meals and offering a bar service as only red wine was offered during the drinks service. Overall, Air France is a great alternative to fly across the Atlantic!","""great alternative to fly across the Atlantic""",8,United Kingdom,19th January 2022,yes
119,air-france,"✅ Trip Verified |  BOD-CDG-ATL: Was having some major issue with Delta Airlines on my return trip due to numerous cancellations (COVID in US) and decided to pick a return flight with Air France instead of Delta. In Bordeaux Airport, a gentleman working at Air France Sales ticket counter worked hard to accommodate me by finding me a good flight for my return trip and thank him for it knowing that Air France had to deal with many stuck Delta Airlines customers in Europe. For Bordeaux to CDG and CDG to Atlanta: Great cabin service and very nice/professional crew. Seats are bit cramped but this is economy. Strange or not but A320 domestic flight has more legroom and width than the 350-900 for the long haul. A pleasurable experience!

120,air-france,"✅ Trip Verified |  My first flight was cancelled last minute, causing me to be rebooked on a second flight. While frustrating, this sometimes can't be helped, especially with COVID and the winter weather. However, my flights were cancelled a total of three times, costing me $450 in COVID test fees, as well as $300 in hotel costs to stay near the airport due to the last minute cancellations and rebookings. Very poor communication from staff to passengers about what was happening with flights - we were sat for over an hour after the initial departure time waiting to hear what was happening, only to be repeatedly told we would be boarding ""soon"", followed by the surprise news that our flight was cancelled. It's incredibly frustrating to have to relay the messages back to my manager back home, and pray the next flight I book won't be cancelled. I understand that the current global situation has placed pressured on airlines, and I wouldn't be leaving a bad review over one cancelled flight. But to be told the flights will ""definitely"" be going ahead, and to be cancelled again and again, is frustrating and unprofessional for everyone involved. It also seems that very few other flights are having this happen to them, and even when I've flown during other points of the pandemic, I've never faced such poor communication and repeated cancellations. Staff were polite, but misinformation was still given, and everything felt poorly organised and poorly communicated to the staff left to answer questions to the stranded passengers.

Air France was very professional despite my upset state and rearranged everything for me, and both my flights during this trip was extremely pleasant. The crew was very nice and helpful.

122,air-france,✅ Trip Verified |  I booked my trip 2 months in advance. This airline canceled my flight in August 2021 the day before departure with no notification (I had received my confirmations and itinerary emails reliably so if something would have been sent I would have seen it. I also checked Spam and all the Promotions and Social folders in desperation). I only found out when I tried to check in online at 5pm the day before and saw it was canceled. I tried multiple times to reach the airline for help and the line hung up automatically after playing a message about the wait time. I would have gladly waited to speak with anyone. Multiple online searches with this airline showed no other flights available to my destination so I had to book a new reservation with a different carrier at more than double the cost ($1400 vs my original $600!). I did receive a full refund of my original purchase price but the airline would not take responsibility for the fact that their poor communication forced me to spend double+ on this trip than was budgeted and it was not possible to cancel and reschedule this trip.,"""I did receive a full refund""",1,United States,16th December 2021,no
123,air-france,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt - Toronto via Paris CDG. My first long-haul flight in pandemic.

Two days later, I still do not have my bag. Upon arrival in IAD, I was informed over the loudspeaker to come to the baggage counter where the form was already filled up for my signature and address for baggage delivery. I expected my bag - priority tagged for a business class ticket - to come 24 hours later on the next daily flight CDG-IAD, But, no, it came on the daily flight two days later. I see no reason why my bag was off loaded in the first place. I had an 8-hour layover in Paris which affords plenty of time for bags to be transferred. Also, I also see no reason why my bag could not have been prioritized for the next available flight to IAD the following day, not two days later.

129,air-france,"✅ Trip Verified |  It was very nice having a wide body with a 1-2-1 lie flat business class layout on a Moscow to Paris segment. Seats were comfortable, WiFi worked very well, and crew were lovely. However, amenities are on the zero side: no blankets / pillows or amenity kit was provided. Catering was also a bit on a low-side: salad was tasty, although no hot food on a 3.5 hour flight, only one kind of tea, not even basic things like lemon is given. CDG is a very confusing airport by its layout, although there were many staff members navigating passengers,  making the transfer efficient. A CDG - LHR leg was uneventful, a typical 1-hour intra-European hop, however, with extremely uncomfortable business class seats. A foie gras as a snack was a very nice touch. All in all, a decent experience for an EU airline. Air France nowadays seems to be a nice option to accrue a good bunch of miles subject to an attractive fare and if they schedule a widebody on a Moscow flight. However, in all other respects, I would strongly prefer KLM as a peer transit airline: they fly from LCY, their Schiphol hub is much much better for transit, the narrowbody seats are way more comfortable and staff generally better. Purely from a customer experience / segmentation perspective, AF seems to be decent, however, just not my type of airline.

130,air-france,"✅ Trip Verified | My experience was very horrible. First they cancelled my flight on the morning I was going to fly. They put me on an alternate flight and when I arrived on the airport, it was a huge mess. The flight was delayed by almost two hours and for that reason I missed my connecting flight from Paris. I had to wait in Paris airport for six hours which caused me to miss my train from Milan to Rome and I did not get a refund for that booking. The air hostesses on the flights were very rude and unhelpful. When I was returning back from Milan to Paris I had requested assistance which unfortunately did not arrive at all at Paris airport. I was made to wait for a very long time and yet the assistance did not arrive. I had to walk by myself to the other terminal to get the connection and had to walk very fast as my time was wasted waiting for the assistance. When I entered the flight the attendants were very rude and did not help me put the luggage away in spite of requesting it. I was asked to do it by myself as they said that they will not do it at all. Again in London I did not receive any assistance and the flight was delayed by one hour they did not seem to care for any travelers who had connecting flights. No one was informed where are flights connection will be from. I had to run like crazy to catch the flight. I was given the wrong gate number when asked by one of the Air France representative. I barely made it to the flight and then I entered the Virgin Atlantic flight to San Francisco which was operated by Air France. I was told that there are only 10 blankets for the entire flight and I will not be able to avail the facility of the blanket. The headphones were broken and unusable.

131,air-france,"Not Verified |  Check-in was a mess. There was a huge line for the Sky Priority check-in counters. No dedicated counters for business class as the cue I was in was mixed up with lots of people traveling in economy, but with status on Delta. Despite arriving at IAD 90 mins before departure, I ended up waiting in-line for almost an hour to check-in and then had to run like a madman to get to the gate. Staff at the counter cited ""staffing shortages"" as the reason for the very slow check-in. I was seated in the first small cabin of business class. I found the seat weird with an oddly positioned aisle side armrest. In the flat position, you feel like you are in a coffin. Food was utterly unremarkable - a pity given that it is a carrier from France which has such wonderful food. The selection of movies was large, but didn't have much of interest. I asked for a second cup of chamomile tea and was told they had run out .. seriously? i have brought my own tea bags if I knew they'd run out of it in business class. Flight attendants were friendly, but not once did any of the FAs respond to my using the call button. Why bother having them if they are going to be ignored.

Well, once in Madrid and right before embarking to Miami, she was refused access to the plane because she did not have a negative PCR. How can an Air France agent let her board a plane for the USA without checking or asking about the PCR test and still clear her to board a plane.

Great selections and quality along with awesome presentation. The 787 is really great for long haul. Good seats, good entertainment, quiet cabin and good amenities. Arrived in DTW approx 45 mins ahead of schedule. The bad part is the ground service. I'm sure the rush to travel now restrictions are being eased does not help, but at both LIS and CDG the boarding process is pandemonium. No-one seems to understand zoned boarding, so you literally have to fight your way through throngs of people to board at your allotted time. The paperwork for Covid related info at CDG was never addressed over the PA, but there was a table (without pens) and some papers that should be filled out, but no-one working the gate said anything until you were scanning your BP with the gate agent, so many people would then retreat back to the table and back through the line of passengers waiting to board. To cap all this, a PAX traveling with her 7 YO son was denied boarding and caused a major commotion for about 20 mins as she had been misinformed about her sons test. OK maybe this isn't on Air France, but from what she screamed to the security agents would suggest she had been given the wrong info by Air France the previous day when she was denied boarding because she didn't have the correct test to travel to USA. After getting the required test she arrived at the gate of my flight only to be denied because her son had not been tested. I know this is 100% on the passenger, but she had been misinformed about this requirement by AF the previous day in regards to her son, so certainly have some sympathy for her. Overall it added enormously to the chaos and CDG is not best equipped to have an entire widebody's load of PAX jostling and not observing any kind of distancing.

150,aeroflot-russian-airlines,"✅ Trip Verified |  Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained; as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.

As a result I missed my flight arriving 5 minutes late to my gate. Other passengers were at the gate before me and still were not allowed to the flight. When I approached the customer desk in Moscow with my issue of a missed flight I still had three more connecting flights left in my round trip ticket. They informed me that the whole ticket was cancelled. It took them months to respond after and no support was provided with regard to my cancelled flights. How about the so called bonus miles program? Apparently it's not even possible to spend them in any way if you haven't reached 3000 miles.

It was obviously not up to me whether to take that flight or not and it is reasonable to expect a full refund. However refund was never provided. I tried to send multiple messages to the airline’s customer service as well with no response. Last week I tried to call Aeroflot customer service. I had to pay for the international call as there are no representatives in Australia where I live. The customer service was extremely poor. To be honest, I have not encountered such poor attitude in years and it was extremely frustrating. The customer service representative could not properly address any of the issues. She said that the only two options are a voucher and reissuing new ticket. Well, I don’t live in Russia or even Europe so there is absolutely no way I can use these options. The reason why I bought a ticket with Aeroflot was that the transfer time was convenient on my way from Rome to Tokyo, I was not even intending to visit Russia. I explained it and no, nothing she was willing to do, just continued quoting new Russian legislation that came into effect half a year after I bought the ticket! I asked to explain how come I was promised a refund previously and was held waiting for months and months and now it’s not an option. She couldn’t explain. She said I can submit complain through the feedback section. I explained that I have tried to communicate the issue through the feedback section already and not getting any response. She said she can’t help with. Then I asked her to connect me to her supervisor and no, she couldn’t do it for some reason. This is the first time ever I couldn’t speak to a customer service manager or a supervisor. Basically the company just decided to keep my money that I paid, go ahead with it and customer service did not care at all. I just lost a lot of money on the international call without any resolution. This situation is absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable. Every other airline I booked with that cancelled flights provided me a refund a while ago, despite COVID-19. Understand there are struggles at the moment and I did accept a voucher from an Australian airline because I can use it living in Australia. But I just can't use an Aeroflot voucher. The ticket wasn’t a cheap ticket either and it was refundable and it is outrageous that I can’t get money back for a ticket that was refundable (and I paid a premium for it to be refundable and have an option to receive a refund). I sent another message to the airline following the call and received the same response about vouchers that is pretty much just their copy paste from the customer service templates.

I flew with my family from Asia to Sweden, via Moscow. Even though we had more than an hour of waiting in Moscow none of our luggage arrived with us in Sweden. We reported it. Aeroflot was extremely unclear about where and when the luggage would come, and they were unable to locate it, until it, different days, arrived in Sweden. It then turned out that one of our hard Samsonite suitcases had a hole in it. It was too big to be acceptable and I therefore made a claim to Aeroflot, in accordance with their procedure. They answered me that I should send original documentation to Moscow. I did so, but was careful enough to make copies of everything. A couple of days later they just closed my claim, without any further explanations. After that I have contacted them a large number of times, making new claims referring to the original one and so forth. When they noticed that I did not give up, they tried a new strategy – to not answer. After months of waiting, I contacted them again, and actually got an answer: that they had increased their own handling time, according to the Russian law (they said), with another 30 days. Then it was silent again. Next time I contacted them they told me to make a new claim, since the first one was not treated! When I said I did not want to they referred to the Swedish Aeroflot office, which in turn told me to send the claim to them. But when the Swedish office answered to my claim it was with the information that they would not handle the case. Indeed, I have to communicate with the Moscow office, they told me. Aeroflot clearly have no intention whatsoever to give me any compensation. If you think that your suitcases and luggage is not so much to care for, you could buy a ticket with Aeroflot, but if you have any luggage that has a value you should think more than once - and then use another air flight company.","""they are a pure disaster""",2,Sweden,27th November 2019,no

It started with the call center confirming our seats the day before travel from the first section of the plane to the end of plane upon check in. We were told boarding was delayed for hours until they finally canceled the flight Los Angeles to Istanbul. We were told to go to the ticket counter for assistance. Needless to say herds of us headed that way only to encounter chaos. No one from Turkish airlines had a contingency plan or a way to establish order. The flight that was checking in was stopped as all employees vanished for a long time. The call center was of no help since they just said the flight is delayed when i am looking at the ticket counter and see the flight canceled info. We were told by an employee to form a line in one stop to be changed to another spot 20 minutes later. Then to be told to go collect baggage and return in order to be attended. Meanwhile there were other travelers who stayed and demanded help which they received (they were traveling to Tel Aviv). My husband and I went to collect baggage and came back to ticket counter. With the same story of form a line here and then there and then moving it yet again, all the meanwhile this group was being assisted the whole time while no one else had this treatment. We finally got tickets for the next flight to Istanbul. We were separated by half a plane for the 13 hour flight. While getting settled in I noticed the same group of people being very demanding to the flight attendants causing them to be unavailable for other passengers due to all their demands. The most turbulence ever on a flight. Upon arrival to Istanbul we encounter 2 flights held awaiting passengers from our flight however ours was not held (which was scheduled to leave even later than the Tel Aviv flight and Barcelona) Our connecting flight was for Belgrade. We were given the biggest runaround through the airport to try and get assistance for next flight to Belgrade and hotel accommodations. After hours we arrive at a hotel in downtown area where now it was midnight and nothing was open. Stranded without food, toiletries and clean clothes. We were picked up 3.5  hours later and dropped off at the airport. No one could help me from Turkish airlines in the Turkish airport!  Arriving to Serbia I called the call center from Serbia to be told my ticket numbers have changed and that is why can’t access my flights on the app or website any longer. Even with the new numbers still have the same problem. I could not select return flight seats over the phone or online. I was told i had to go to the main office in Belgrade. My husband is 6’6” and needs extra leg room. Not an option. I sent emails to complain about situation and try to receive help to only be told “we are sorry for inconveniences”. Needless to say I am in Belgrade to try and receive help at their office. Worse service ever! “Due to covid” no one in office can do anything other than ticket purchases. I am dreading the flights back home. I will encourage any and all people thinking about traveling with Turkish airlines to reconsider.

As well their customer service agents in the airport are very rude, and abrupt. They made derogatory comments to me in Turkish the customer service agents definitely do not help their customers. I made a complaint to the company and I’m still waiting for a response. Upon my arrival in Istanbul airport on Monday February 14th I immediately called Turkish Airlines for reservation for my cat. I was told (though the representative asked me of the breed and the size of my pet I provided) that the cabin had reached its capacity limit and that the only option I had was to put my cat in the holding cargo. The representative even told me that I must have a hard carrier for my cat since she’s going to be put in the cargo. She then reserved a spot for my cat and told me that I’d receive an email confirmation for the requests. I received two emails. First email was for the cabin and it was not confirmed due to full capacity but second email was confirmed for cargo. The representative did not tell me that my cat was not allowed in the cargo and went ahead with the reservation. Based on the confirmation I received from Turkish Airlines I proceeded with my flight as usual on February 16th. I was held for the entire duration of the check out at Turkish airport with many different excuses from several different agents and scenarios and no clear explanation why I couldn’t fly at that time. The first reason was that my cat couldn’t be in the cargo area because there was a large dog and then the other reason was that I didn’t have sufficient documents and then they said that Because of my cat’s breed (exotic shorthair) I hadn’t reserved for my cat far in advance. I was extremely stressed out and the frustration was unbearable and above all my cat was in a lot of distress and hunger and thirst and no where litter box for her toilet. The Turkish Airlines staff were extremely unprofessional, unhelpful, and rude with me. They all refused to provide me with their name.  I experienced the worst customer service from a big company that I once thought they were a decent airline to fly with. This whole issue started all internally within the airline and no one wanted to help out. I was told by customer relations to wait in the airport until management team calls me to provide me with hotel, transportation, and my next flight for free of charge because this was the airline error and not mine.

For unknown (according to Thailand Doctors) reason my father died on the plane and the plane made an emergency landing in Phuket Thailand. They sent my dead father and mother to the hospital by ambulance even though he was dead for a couple of hours. We received one phone call by the hostess to say they were being taken to hospital and confirming my father had died already even though Turkish airlines have in their reports that he died in hospital. I'm guessing to avoid any responsibility. For the next several hours, every family member including grandkids were calling Phuket hospitals trying to find my mother. Imagine your 72 year old mother who has severe asthma, Crohn's disease and has had triple heart by-pass surgery stuck in a foreign country with high humidity with limited English. No thanks to Turkish airlines we tracked down my parents to a hospital ourselves. We are grateful for the Thai people whom were very nice to my mother.

How we came to know about this is the flight update screen at the airport which we thought was glitching as expected time was showing as expected but had another value of time in front of it which was odd so hence we inquired at customer service.  Customer service was the most demeaning, inhumane and stressful experience. We couldn't even make it to the desk before an airline rep pulled us out asked our flight number and without any info about what's going on? what are our options? asked a question to us ""Food? Yes? No?"" I replied just want to understand our flight situation as nothing is updated or conveyed to us. He replied No food? Ok passport? I gave him the passport thinking ok some resolution finally but he took it went behind the desks, vanished there in the back in the kiosk and came back after 15 min. Asked me again, Food? I said  what's up with flight?. So again we got back in the line up so we could talk to a human maybe. Reached a lady finally, nicely asked about what's going on with flight and what are the options, accommodations. Lady said the flight that was at 9 is now in the morning (it took me good long time to get this info) she said no hotel we don't accommodate. Anyways back and forth she got agitated and threatened to call police which Ironically I should be calling as I was being robbed. I stepped back because if this was customer service imagine how police would be. Went to another line again now this time a gentleman, pretty straight forward told me he doesn't deal with that side of the business but can help me give options and the options was a substitute flight that will go to a different city and we need to figure out on our own from there. Which of course we took as I wanted to be out of there ASAP. Every single person in that line up, regardless of my flight or a different destination was extremely frustrated, crying or with hopeless face. So it wasn't just us with our first world problems I guess. On the way back to Canada (from Lahore to Istanbul to Toronto).  Without any notification our morning flight got 8-9 hours delay, we came to know about is due to my previous incoming experience this time I kept checking online status of departures through airports website because as usual Turkish Airline website and app were still showing on time. The Turkish airline office in Lahore does not open at times that displays on their site and there is no local number, agent or helpline to update your ticket when they delayed and messed up all the connections. (and no no email or updated itinerary) Anyways so we reached with all our luggage at airport just in case you never know. They finally open at 5 am instead of 2 am which the site said.

Despite being in the middle of a global pandemic, few passengers and none of the gate staff wore masks. Passengers were advised they would have to put on masks on the plane. Then, at the point at which we should have boarded, the gate agent came back into the room and informed passengers (maskless of course and expelling aerosols over everyone) that the ground crew would not be able to load the plane and that any passengers with checked bags would not get them in Milan. These passengers could decide not to travel or follow up the missing bags later. We then boarded to be held on the ground for 2 hours while they attempted to resolve what transpired to me a wildcat strike by ground staff. The announcements from the cockpit were few and far between and refused to take any responsibility for the situation or suggest any attempts to mitigate it. The cabin crew did not nothing to police mask wearing among the passengers, with people sneezing and coughing all over the cabin while not wearing masks. Indeed, the crew were rather casual in mask wearing themselves, with the purser frequently pulling hers down. We eventually left and arrived two hours late. Upon arrival into Milan, we were all piled into a crowded bus, again with no checking of mask wearing. Admittedly, the crew did offer free water and a small snack to apologize for the delay.

284,wizz-air,"✅ Trip Verified |  There is a new model of airline that desperately wants to undercut the prices of other airlines to get your business, and that is Wizz Air. They present a low priced ticket to snipe your attention and your money, then once you’ve committed your purchase, they add on all of the extras. Do you  want to sit with your young child? They’ll charge you for that. Do you want to carry a bag with you larger than a computer case? They’ll charge you for that. Did you want to check in for your flight somehow? They’ll charge you for that (they even charge for online check in). You get a cheap price up front until they secure your business, but once they have it, the stack on the extra fees until your ticket price becomes comparable to an actual reputable airline. You will not be able to fly without paying extra fees. Because I didn’t check in online the day before (because you know, I have things to do before I go on vacation) they charged me an extra $150 dollars just to do a regular check in. Then, because I had a cabin-sized bag and a camera bag, they charged me an extra $25 for that. Then because I didn’t pay for assigned seats they actually sat my four year old child away from us. They had it on record that he was four years old and their seating arrangement came up with that! Can you believe it? Sure we could switch it around so he wasn’t unaccompanied, but they were perfectly fine with separating the child from his family because a fee wasn’t paid. That’s a pretty gross business practice and I almost wonder if it was intentional because a fee wasn’t paid. For real. This becomes a moral and ethical issue when they will make a child sit alone unless you pay an extra fee for seating. It’s actually a disgusting business model and I will never fly this deceptive airline again. Just pay the extra money for a more reputable airline instead of this sneaky nonsense that Wizz Air pulls on its clients. So what is Wizz Air prioritizing? Cheap shot fees over customer service and satisfaction. DO NOT book this airline because it looks like a deal. It is not a good deal. They will loot you in one way or another by the time you get on that plane, and if you don’t pay the extra fees, they’ll show you why you better pay them in advance next time.

Right away, I am asked for my covid documentation which I have in the form of the EU Digital CovidPass, which is accepted in Iceland and is what I obtained especially for this trip (I'm am American citizen and was fully vaccinated in America, which makes this a lengthy process). The girl at check in says that it is not sufficient and I will also need a negative covid test to travel. First of all! I checked the travel restrictions for Iceland several times prior to my journey and read in numerous places that a test was not necessary. ""Can you visit Iceland? Yes. All travelers – regardless of origin – are welcome to visit Iceland if they can show either a certificate of full vaccination against COVID, or a certificate of previous COVID infection."" - Icelandair I assume, therefore, that with my EU residence permit and EU Digital CovidPass, that I would be OK for travel. Second of all, neither that service that I booked through (Kiwi) or my airline (Wizz) provided any information about what documents I would need until the second I arrived at the gate, only 30 minutes before the closing of check-in. Finally, almost everyone who I interacted with was rude, and completely uninterested in helping me find a solution. I could have received a rapid test at Budapest airport in time, or there is a perfectly valid option to receive a test in Iceland and quarantine until the results return. No matter the suggestion I made, the Wizz Air authorities were disrespectful and adamant that I do not board the plane. And I believe its also relevant to add that I'm a 19 year old solo female traveler, for which the thought of missing my flight and being stranded in a foreign country is not particularly pleasant, however I was met with no sympathy from anyone during this experience.

They were not able to accept payment at the check-in counter, so we had to find a hidden counter at the end of the airport (not even labeled with Wizz Air) in order to pay. The payment system was painfully slow, taking up to 10 minutes per person since they had to document the payment through handwriting. This process took an hour to go through about five groups. No exaggerating. Then our flight didn't even start boarding on time, as the flight before us from Wizz Air was exceptionally delayed due to a large number of passengers needing to do the same process of paying to be able to check-in.

We got up at 0300 in order to be at the airport at 0400 as advised by easyJet, I was emailed at 01:07 on the day to be told that our flight had been cancelled, they gave us under 5 hours notice! We decided to go to the airport to see what our options would be, as we were travelling due to a family bereavement. We arrived at Bristol Airport at 0400 to be greeted by a very busy easyJet check in area. I made my way to the special assistance desk as this had the smallest queue. We were approached by a easyJet representative, I explained our situation and we were rudely told that we needed to go onto the easyJet app and to sort it out ourselves, they were too busy to help. I asked to speak to the duty manager, who eventually came over to see me, they explained that we were expected to manage our own booking via the app, after explaining out circumstances and the reasons we were due to travel they agreed to transfer us onto another easyJet flight to Antalya later on that day at 1520, and that we would have to pay for the onward 6 hour road transport to take us to our original location in Bodrum, to keep the receipt and claim the money back as there policy states they are only able to book road transport within the UK and not overseas. We were advised that our original flight was cancelled due to crew sickness. Apparently easyJet had no standby crew available in order to allow our flight to Bodrum depart. No empathy was shown by any easyJet ground staff at Bristol. When we boarded our new flight to Antalya we were advised by the cabin crew that the operating aircraft had not been restocked therefore no duty free was available and they had very limited food and drink to sell onboard.

So we were forced to upgrade to “upfront seats” (+25€ per person) to have a cabin suitcase. This option also includes a priority check in with the EasyJet Plus queue to skip the normal long single queue for check in (see screenshot of easyJet email). We arrived in the Lisbon airport terminal 2 more than 2 hours in advance though we knew that we could have priority check in at EasyJet plus. When we waited for a while and finally arrived at the counter 203, the woman there was very rude and told us they do not have priority boarding today and that she doesn’t know anything about it. We insisted with the proof from our email we can skip the long queue at the check in counters. She didn’t even bother to look at what was written in that easyJet email nor give any explanation to why this service was removed “today”. She said the priority boarding is only for people who require special assistance. She was like “oh your flight is to Paris, you’ve got plenty of time” in a nonchalant manner. And she just spoke directly to the clients in the long queue, “next one”, waving us away.  No apologies, no emails from easyJet communicating this before we arrive at the airport and nothing was written before people started queuing. We paid an extra 50 euros for this extra convenience but they did not honour their contract and completely ignored us at the EasyJet plus counter. We spoke to the service centre (Portway) for the airline at the airport but the woman there also refused to help. Said she can’t do anything about it. So we waited almost 1.5 hours in the normal queue. After we got our boarding passes, I met a lady in front of us had the same case as what we endured, but worse. She was refused on the EasyJet plus priority check in queue and then refused her boarding because she was “late”. So she missed her flight. Both of us arrived more than 2 hours before the flight time (the check in counter only opens 2 hours before the flight time). But I had to run to the gates in order not to miss my flight.

Aweek before departure, we observed changes overnight in the restrictions introduced in Germany due to the prevailing pandemic. We have completed all the documents required by the German side so that our trip could take place. In addition, we checked the EasyJet app and EasyJet Hub every day to be sure that any additional changes would not affect our flight. The last change made to the Easyjet Hub took place on December 20. On the day of departure, the Easy jet staff responsible for boarding informed us that we would not be admitted to the flight to Berlin because we have Polish passports and we do not have a transit ticket (from Berlin Brandenburg airport to another airport). The situation was extremely stressful for us, because despite having all the necessary documents, we were refused a flight. We asked to contact the shift manager to confirm this decision, informing in advance that we had spent too much time trying to resolve the situation, which could result in the inability to change the flight (we could have changed the flight up to 2 hours before departure) we informed the staff that I am pregnant and this situation stressed me as well as my five-year-old son, yet we were told to wait for the manager's decision.

335,easyjet,"Not Verified |  We decided to use Easyjet to fly back to the UK from Krakow and arrived at the airport in good time. We flew to Krakow with Ryanair and had all our documentation to hand and everything went without a hitch. We did notice that some passengers did not have a Locator Form but the Ryanair staff simply gave them blank forms to complete and there was not any problem. Our flight with Easyjet proved to be very different as we were returning home we thought that a Locator Form would not be required and there was no early indication of this from Easyjet ground staff. As we were checking in the Easyjet staff asked for our locator forms and bluntly told us to complete them online. This meant filling in a lengthy form and also finding the 2 day PCR test reference number, which we did with some effort and succeeded in checking in just in time. We were last on the plane and others who failed to produce a locator form missed their flight. Easyjet ground staff were completely indifferent. There was no indication given at any early stage which would have given us time to leisurely complete the paperwork.

I missed the first flight due to all trains from Victoria being stopped due to a poor soul who jumped in front of a train. EasyJet's policy is you lose the ticket and are required to buy a new ticket. Fine, I did that at the cost of 85 pounds. When I arrived at the gate for the second flight I realized I left my purse at security. The two gate agents would not call security and they would not give me the number for security. Hence I missed another flight at this point it became a comedy show due to the incompetence of EasyJet personnel, this was from the manager to a supervisor to customer service people who are clueless. Long story short me along with another couple who missed the flight because they were held in security needed to buy another ticket. This cost 110 pounds because they failed to inform us that if you don’t buy the ticket with more than two hours prior to the flight you have to pay their exorbitant fee of 110 versus 85.

The second flight was cancelled 30 mins before departure, it was complete chaos as we had to stay overnight in Italy as they scheduled the replacement flight to be at 7am which meant we had to be in the airport at 5am, this was very inconvenient for us for many obvious reasons. They did cover the hotel expense but frankly the reason we are not happy is because the airline lied about the weather conditions being bad so that we would not be eligible for any kind of flight refund other than overnight hotel stay. How do we know they lied? Simple, other airlines kept flying and the weather in Milan was quite ok, not rainy or windy. Other reasons we were unhappy? We checked in our bag before departure and since the flight was cancelled we had no information whatsoever about where we can get our bag back , in addition to the fact that we didn't have any other information on what to do already 10 pm in a city where we never been before.

348,easyjet,"Not Verified |  On Friday 13th August at roughly 20.00hrs our flight from Gibraltar to Gatwick was cancelled due to fog. After waiting another hour in the departure lounge, we were informed ‘Easyjet have been unable to find an alternative route or accommodation for the night. Please leave the airport by Gate number 5 and arrange your own accommodation’. After a frantic search online it did appear that all the hotels in Gibraltar were full. We were able to make contact with the host of the AirBNB that we had been staying at for the previous three nights and although his AirBNB was full, he made space for us in another property and charged us £160 for the emergency one nights stay. We took a taxi to his place and stayed the night. During the night we received an email from EasyJet informing us that our flight would take place at 18.00 the following day, 14th August. We therefore had to spend another whole day in Gibraltar. Obviously, we needed to eat and drink for our additional time there. At the end of this extra day, we took another taxi back to Gibraltar airport and thankfully our next flight left on time. A few days later we submitted an expenses claim to Easyjet for 2 x taxi transfers, 1 night’s accommodation and for meals and drinks during the day we were delayed. Easyjet have agreed to pay for one of our taxi journeys only! They have stated – the second taxi expense did not show a ‘route’ on the receipt so they will not pay. The food and drinks receipts we submitted were not itemised so they will not pay. The accommodation receipt did not have a date stamp on it (even though it was dated the 14th August the day after we should have gone home) so they will not pay. Easyjet flight cancellation actually cost us £289.00 and they have agreed to reimburse us £20!

I sat on seat 17a which I picked and the seat was reasonably comfortable for a 4 hour flight and this flight was meant to be on 737-800 and for a picky person into aviation this was a huge bonus as we were given TVs. Food and drink was offered however I got myself a Burger King prior to the flight however I did get a Diet Coke on the flight - forgot the price. We landed in quite hard and my favourite bit - the airport. Getting through the first part of immigration was fast and easy but when we had to joint the vaccination/covid test line which had 2 desks and 4 flights that was terrible. Then the baggage we had to wait almost 2 hours for due to a mix up made us even more tired and stressed.

This flight was probably my best flight with them as the crew were absolutely great and we were on a 787-9 Dreamliner on a 3.45 minute flight.

356,tui-airways,"✅ Trip Verified |  On our flight no. TB181 from Brussels to Punta Cana on 15/08/2021, we sat in the Deluxe section and while the flight crew was very nice, a lot of passengers either weren’t wearing any masks at all and only had them hanging from their chins, or some just had them on to cover their mouths but not their noses. On such a long flight, I expected to see everyone wearing their masks correctly (except for eating & drinking, but people were not wearing their masks (correctly) for hours). The flight crew didn’t say anything, only when I asked them directly they managed to ask a woman in front of us to put on her mask. She did, but as soon as the flight attendant was gone, she made an obscene gesture towards a sign that told the passengers to wear masks and proceeded to free her nose. When we in process of landing, one of the flight attendants was standing directly in front of us, next to us was a man that didn’t wear any mask at all and loudly talked to his neighbour in the middle row. Both didn’t wear their masks, but the flight attendant didn’t say anything at all. I am very disappointed with the crew and especially with TUI fly for not enforcing basic hygiene rules despite the Covid-19 pandemic still going on. I will not be flying with Tui again despite having flown with them for years and I regret already having booked the return flight to Brussels because this shows the company doesn’t care for their passengers’ safety at all.

The boarding at Gatwick was done in a corvid safe manner and the cabin crew explained that a face mask had to be worn for the duration of the flight and whist in the arrival airport in Corfu. The Cabin Services Manager explained that due to Corvid there movement in the cabin was to be kept to a minimum and there would only be the 2 rear toilets in customer use and teh=at there was only t be a maximum of 4 passengers standing at any one time, also the there would only be one cabin service of food and drinks. We were given regular updates form the cockpit which were clear and friendly. The pilots pointed out places of interest on the route down to Corfu. Arrival at Corfu and deplaning was well organised and the Cabin Crew controlled the exit of the aircraft onto the waiting coaches. The flight back to Gatwick was an evening flight and again the Cabin Service manager explained that there were only 2 rear toilets for customer use and there would only be one drinks service. However, there was a tax free trolley has well on this flight has the banned had been lifted.

I was basically charged £84 just to choose a standard seat, when Easyjet would be £16. The selfish TUI airline staff also shut the front aircraft toilets to public and kept it to themselves, and all people on aircraft had to use rear toilets. When I complained to TUI about people queueing in aisle and standing over me, I was lied to and told all airline companies have done the same during Covid 19 pandemic, which is a lie as Easyjet kept all toilets open to public on flight in same week.

The aircraft was clean and tidy and the crew were very friendly and efficient with the in-flight catering was more than acceptable. What helped, perhaps, was that we left at 1000 and had a daytime flight heading west. We also found subsequently that we were in 'extra legroom seats' and this made a huge difference. The homeward flight left Barbados at 1700 and effectively became a night flight heading east with breakfast served at 0330(UK Time) or 2330 (Barbados time). We were also in a standard economy seat with limited legroom. I am 1m82 and found it difficult to get comfortable. When i reclined my seat after dinner the passenger behind took offence.

One of toilets also had no water in the taps. We paid for and got extra legroom next to the emergency exit but the seats didn’t recline and were so thinly padded they were uncomfortable. As the flight wasn’t full some others were moved to similar seats across the aisle but cabin crew failed to explain to them(as they did to us) what to do in the unlikely event of needing to evacuate via that exit (surely a breach of safety regulations).

370,tui-airways,"Not Verified |  Larnaca to Manchester. I recently enjoyed a holiday with my family group of 7 consisting of 4 adults and 3 children. The first point is with regard to the online check-in service on the outward flight. My wife and I have always checked in via the normal procedure at the check in desk. My daughter preferred the online method. To my mind, our use of the unfamiliar touch screen procedure seemed no quicker than letting an experienced check-in desk assistant carry out the task. One of my daughter's cases was found to be 2.5kg over the modest 15kg allowance. There is every chance that a person may waive this minor indiscretion, but the online system is totally abitrary culminating in a £45 surcharge, this was later waived by a TUI assistant to be fair. Moving onto the flight itself there were no issues of note other than being on a dull as dishwater Boeing 757. Very basic. The week long holiday at Tofinis Hotel near Ayia Napa was great, enjoyed the food etc. No probs. On the return flight we found it to be delayed just prior to the return transfer. 2 hours on a late night flight but no major issues, these things happen. However, it was common knowledge amongst the passengers due to internet checks but on arrival, the TUI rep chose not to mention it. I sort of understand that because why would anyone make themselves the focal point of peoples frustration if you dont have to. Onto the flight and again we found ourselves on the rather tired looking 757. I suspect TUI are suffering due to the grounding of the 737 max of which they were the biggest customers and I understand the company's predicament. The flight was adequate and on landing at Manchester we found the airport was disorganised due in part to procedural disruption arising from the ongoing terminal expansion. We were held on the plane and kept informed over the tannoy by a clearly irritated member of the cabin crew who informed us that we needed to be bused from the tarmac to terminal and the airport hadn't been expecting us! Half an hour later we were disembarking and the journey was complete. The following day I felt as rough as sandpaper, cold symptoms and a sore throat. I cannot conclusivly put this down to the plane journey but it is known that changes in air pressure can cause physiological effects like toothache and joint pain. Having taken trips on the uber modern TUI Dreamliners with their humidified cabin air I had forgotten just how rough an old plane could leave you feeling.

371,tui-airways,"✅ Trip Verified | I have holidayed in Corfu for the last 25 years and appreciate that the runway is short. The outbound flight landing has to be the worst I have ever experienced, to my mind we were approaching too high and too fast. We landed heavily with the aircraft lurching from side to side, hanging on for dear life - not a pleasant start to the holiday! The return flight started positively but on the approach to London Stansted we came down in fits and starts causing a lot of anxiety. Other passengers were also concerned about the roller coaster descent and there was huge relief when the plane landed and eventually came to a halt. However we were left onboard without the doors being opened for almost half an hour after the engines had stopped with no explanation as to why.

I tried several times to contact them and complete my check in but no one was willing to help or even explain. Finally I arrived at the airport approximately 2 hours before my flight but I was not allowed to check in, although I didn't have any check in bags and my flight was delayed.

377,tui-airways,"✅ Trip Verified |  Aberdeen to Rhodes. This flight was operated by TUI’s sister airline Sunwing Airlines. The flight was included in a 2 week holiday on the island. The flight was full; however, due to it being during the school year most passengers were older or couples without children. One thing I have to say is I was surprised with the service on this 4 hour 42 minute flight. The menu had a wide variety of options and was reasonably priced, but there was no option to preorder a meal like with Thomas Cook or Jet2. The 6 person cabin crew consisted of 5 cabin crew and the TUI Airways Aberdeen base Manager. The crew were friendly, chatty and there to help in the cabin. They made some jokes during announcements, which was great. The pilots were informative. My seat was 8F and offered 29” of seat pitch, and recline which was enough. The toilets were checked regularly and they were clean, but on the small side. The landing into Rhodes airport was smooth but the airport, that is a story for a different time. Overall I am impressed with the flight considering it was the first time I flew with TUI Airways. One thing I do have to say is TUI Airways is a rather expensive airline for scheduled flights. My flight would have came out at around £300 round trip for my dates of travel. TUI Airways is the perfect airline if you have booked a holiday with TUI, just like I did, otherwise there are definitely cheaper options.

Long Haul Flight Only includes no check in luggage. 7kg hand luggage is the only allowance included in advertised cost. It is then £35 each way for up to 20kg. It is then £16 to choose a seat. The check in is very long process. Waited 1hr 40 minutes as only 2 desks open for economy. No one checked my hand luggage for size and weight so their policy is void therefore a money making misleading scam. On board the staff were brash and let’s say tired looking shouting out “prosseco £20 Prosecco £20” Entertainment was laughable. Hardly anything to watch. Food mediocre. Toilets!

They were all so polite and friendly and nothing was too much trouble and certainly helped the long flight pass. On the way out a passenger took ill and this was dealt with efficiently and very calmly and the only reason we new about it was because a doctor was sitting in front of us and was asked for his help. I have difficulty walking so had ordered a wheelchair from the cabin to the baggage collection which didn't turn up and the whole crew waited with me and my family until it came, despite me telling them to go home they all refused, even the captain.

The Boeing 787 is a nice aircraft, large windows & the famed pressurisation ensuring a higher level of comfort. However, the seats were showing signs of age and generally the plane was dirty, especially the toilets. Seating is also cramped in 3-3-3 layout. What is worse is the truly dreadful food, in way too small quantities, as well as the quite mediocre service, with some truly surly staff members (though not all). They also seat you apart randomly if you do not pay extra.

They use Orlando Sanford which our preferred airport to arrive and depart from due to its size and speed to travel through. The planes they use are relatively new against Virgin 747s (Over 30 years old) and BA 777 (20 plus years old). Leg room is generous for economy. Flights are generally on time, with the last visit in September 2018, both flights pushed back early. The food is okay for airline fare, with plenty of drink runs by the crew.

The crew were excellent and very friendly and helpful. However, our experience in Rhodes airport was not good. We travelled as a party of nine; five adults, an eight year old, a six year old, a four year old and a three year old. As the lead member I felt responsible for our party. When we were directed to our check in desk I double checked with the Tui representative in the airport that we were at the Cardiff check in. Her reply was very patronising in its nature, ""that's why I sent you here"". She was not very pleasant at all. We were told briefly on the coach to the airport that we would have to weigh our luggage then take it to be scanned but I don't think it was explained clearly enough. However, the departure gate was very confusing. We were told that we were going from departure gate 7. We got there but the door was shut. We waited and eventually an airport assistant told us we had to go to passport control first then proceed through departure lounges 4, 5 & 6 to reach gate 7. We queued up after this only to realise that we were in the Luton queue, also going from gate 7. None of the monitors around us displayed the procedure. I understand that this is not Tui's fault but perhaps the representatives could explain this on the coach to the airport?

He was very impatient and by the time we were on a return flight, we were forced to move seats, sitting separately. Really late boarding by over 1.5 Hours, departure area is terrible at Corfu Airport, so very very uncomfortable there, and there is no airport lounge. Food very expensive.

Both outbound and inbound flights were on time and the staff onboard were courteous and professional. The seats and inflight service are in line with other short-haul flights and budget airlines - was perfectly acceptable for a 3 hour flight. The only downside was ground crew (which were not TUI Airways) being a bit slow with the delivery of luggage, but that is partly due to the summer peak season. They are primarily geared up for passengers flying as part of a TUI/First Choice package holiday which means the fares are not great value, but since it was the only airline offering this route I was happy to fly with them and would consider doing so again.","""overall good standard service""",8,United Kingdom,8th August 2018,yes

Flight to Cancun, cabin premium. Evening check in of baggage at LGW is helpful if staying overnight at the airport and was easily done. As part of their premium package they include premium security passes and lounge access, security was quick, the No 1 traveller lounge was busy but fine for quick snack. The aircraft was only 4 months old so was clean and well presented. Welcome drinks offered shortly after priority boarding and Rituals amenity pack handed out. On time departure. The inflight service as a whole was very good, bar service after take off and menu choices taken crew very attentive with a real can do attitude. The first meal was nicely presented with main course brought out separately after started finished. Good inflight movies etc and regular bar services during flight for those that wanted it. A tasty afternoon tea was served prior to landing with sandwiches, Victoria sponge cake and scone/roddas clotted cream. The first officer made announcements during the flight which being both a day and leisure flight was a nice touch. Baggage off belt quickly. A very good flight. I have to conclude by saying that holding a high tier status with our flag carrier, they were the alternative consideration. However, having flown with them regularly, they would not have emulated the service TUI provided in their premium economy cabin and a 20 year old 777 would have struggled to compete with the Dreamliner!","""service as a whole was very good""",9,United Kingdom,18th July 2018,yes

After about 30 minutes we got to the zig zag line so thought that we would soon be through, only to find that the queue extended down the tunnel towards terminal 3 for some 200 metres, doubled back then you got to the zig zag queue. After almost 3 hours with our flight time approaching we got to the root of the problem. Only 3 tui staff supervising travellers to check in their luggage using the installed self serve machines. We managed to check most of our luggage in, but the machine wouldnt accept one of them. We asked for assistance 3 times and waited but got no assistance for over half an hour.

Queuing barriers were arranged near escalators causing unnecessary congestion and confusion amongst passengers. Airline staff were no where to be seen to offer assistance and guidance to passengers. Boarding seemed to go smoothly however this was probably because the Cabin Crew were not asking to see boarding passes. My seat was uncomfortable and unsupportive due to the padding being worn out. Food and drinks were very expensive (even at airline prices) so would recommend you buy in the airport before the flight. The in charge crew member was putting on some silly voice whilst making announcements which literally made me cringe and squirm in my seat. My seat area and tray table were filthy and the aircraft looked as though it had not been cleaned properly in a while e.g. large clumps of dust around air vents etc. Some of my travelling party are former cabin crew and spotted numerous things that the crew were not doing e.g. not checking boarding passes? How do you know who is getting on the plane.

Complete waste of my time. And secondly (and TUI are by no means the only offenders) why did they have no food for purchase on the return leg? It is not rocket science to calculate that on a long-ish flight like that that passengers will want something to eat in both directions, so for goodness sake order enough from the caterers for BOTH legs of the flight.

Once we received the email from Norwegian that our flight was canceled, we called to look into a refund or credit.

We explained we used a credit card we no longer had; the customer service agent said, ""We can't even confirm that was your card in the first place.""  She later said, "" the best we can do is push out the trip as late as August."" Okay, and my response was, and if COVID-19 is still blocking travel, then what?

I am a big fan of the airline. Almost always on time. Very friendly crew, especially in the long haul operation. Free wifi for all passengers regardless of ticket type (both short and long haul) and operates gate to gate (so no annoying need to log in and out on take off and landing). The premium offering long haul is, I would say, better than most airlines' premium economy but not as good as business class. Yet the price is exceptionally low for what you get. Essentially you pay about a normal airline's economy fare or less for an experience better than premium economy. The food in premium is high quality as are the drinks and the seats are good enough to get a reasonable sleep (although this is not a lie flat bed per business class). The IFE is modern and high quality albeit with a slightly smaller range of movies than a normal airline. Whilst Norwegian are no Ryanair, it is worth remembering that this is a budget airline. You are getting a major discount on long haul with a normal airline but in return you need to follow their rules. If your hand baggage weighs more than 10kg (or 15kg in premium) they will make you pay to check it in. In economy, you don't get a meal unless you pre-order and pay.

The Norwegian desks were straight ahead from emerging from the exit from the railway terminal at the South terminal. A quick stop at the kiosk to check in and collect my boarding card the machine without prompting also printed another boarding card that acts as your lounge access pass. Very efficient. There was no queue at the Premium bag drop so I was straight to the agent via the security officer asking the usual questions. Bag drop done in seconds and headed to security screening. Norwegian does not provide fast track security at Gatwick but this wasn't an issue as it was really quick and I was airside in about 3 minutes. Gatwick process and technology not making us remove laptops and liquids. The lounge offering for Norwegian Premium Flex customers at Gatwick is the third party MyLounge. Whilst smart and comfortable has a very basic F&B offering. But it was a relaxing way to start the day. I deliberately didn't board until nearer departure so again had no queue at the gate where there is priority boarding for Premium customers. Once on board and after easily finding stowage for my back pack I was offered a glass of water, apple juice or orange juice. A bit dull. A glass of even prosecco would have been well received! I had seat 1A by the window. This front row seat is by the bulkhead and whilst offers no extra legroom than the other Premium seats, the front row has a major advantage; no passenger in front reclining into your space. From my experience flying Premium on other carriers this seat is really up there at the top. The leather covered armchair is wide with about 46"" seat pitch with a lot of recline and an extendable calf supporting foot rest. Whilst a flat bed it is not, it is very comfortable. The IFE comes out on a stalk from one of the arm rests and was easy to use. This even allows you to order drinks or snacks at your seat in between meal services. But I was surprised how poor and dated the choice of movies was. I really struggled to find something I wanted to watch. The inflight service did not start until we had departed about an hour. This was a drinks service and in Premium beer, wine and non-alcoholic beverages are free of charge throughout the flight. But if you want a cocktail you have to pay. I chose red wine though both wine offerings were low end. There are no pretzels, nuts or other snacks offered unless you're prepared to pay for them, which is a bit poor. The main meal was delivered about 30 mins later together with more drinks. As I was in the first row there was 3 choices available. I would say the food quality and quantity was on par with the likes of a BA Premium Economy meal, but it looked cheap as it is served in this flimsy long cardboard box holder with the entree still in foil and metal and very cheap plastic cutlery. The crew were responsive if you requested more beverages throughout the flight, but not particularly warm or friendly. About 90 minutes out of Miami a second meal service was offered. This was a salad with meat and bread rolls offered. Perfectly adequate quality and quantity as not the main meal. Again a full beverage service was offered identical to with the main meal.

452,tap-portugal,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dreadful airline. Transferring in Lisbon, I was denied from boarding the flight to Miami due to my PCR test having been taken over 24 hours ago (but fewer than 48 hours). It didn't matter that I'm a US citizen returning to the USA, having a vaccination card with 2 doses and a booster, they sent me off to take the 2-hour PCR test. The gate staff gave me wrong directions to the COVID testing desk, which I finally found after 30 minutes of walking around all throughout the secure area, just to discover that there is actually no 2-hour PCR test. The gate agent had lied to me to get me to leave the gate, and now it was too late to get on that flight. What followed was endless queues to exit the airport's secure area (~2 hours wait), to speak to a useless customer service representative (~1.5 hours wait) who told me they will not refund any part of the flight or even help me reschedule it, to take another PCR test (~1 hour wait). During check-in at Frankfurt, nobody from the airline staff cared to mention to me the new 24-hour PCR test requirement, so I had no idea that a terrible surprise awaited in Lisbon. I spent the night sleeping across some hard plastic seats in the airport. I had to buy a new ticket at full price, paid $110 for a small checked bag, and $100 for the PCR test. Outrageous prices, useless customer service, endless queues, and employees who simply don't care.

453,tap-portugal,Not Verified |  Very bad experience with TAP. Our flight via Lisbon was delayed due to fog at Lisbon. Ground crew at Lisbon were almost non-existent and provided no assistance to ensure we reached Faro in a reasonable amount of time (they proposed laying on a coach to arrive at the airport at 3am!). Crew on the flight were apologetic but couldn’t help. Drinks and meal service was very poor - I don’t expect asparagus for breakfast! Lounge was overly busy and food and drinks selection was equally poor. Flight back from Portugal to UK was just as bad - no lounge or fast-track security provided at Faro; bag drop only open two hours before departure. Flight late. Business class flights for this time of year were cheap but the cost in stress was more than the saving. There were no redeeming features of this trip and I cannot recommend TAP to any traveller.,"""Very bad experience with TAP""",1,United Kingdom,17th April 2022,no
454,tap-portugal,"✅ Trip Verified |  Really a very bad experience with TAP, as they managed to cancel my flight and delay my 2 suitcases for more than 48 hours. It all started on April 9 when I had a flight from Rome to Lisbon with TAP. A few hours ago I was informed that the flight was canceled (TP 843) without a reason and I was scheduled for flight TP 837 to Lisbon the next day. Also from a simple internet search I found that TP843 on Sundays is often canceled. Arriving in Lisbon, however, the surprise was even greater when I found that my luggage had been lost. I reported the incident to Handling company, Groundforce, in order an amount for basic necessities to be approved, as they did not know where my luggage was or when it would arrive. Groundforce referred me to TAP Customer Service Offices at Lisbon Airport. The queue was really outrageous. I waited 8 hours when I decided to leave with at least 50 passengers in front of me with similar requests. No one from the company was interested in so many people. No customer-centric approach. No sensitivity for the customer who trusted (wrongly) this company. No organization, no empathy. I believed that the company's telephone service would be better. Unfortunately 45 minutes of waiting and no one answered. Also, no one has answered the tickets through the complaints system until today, 1 week later. My request was simple: I was seeking compensation for the cancellation of the flight and the satisfaction of my expenses for basic items until my luggage appeared. It is a shame that this company is still operating. This image is a shame. One should resign from the executives. The image of the complaints office at Lisbon airport shows their mentality, huge queue even now. Shame on them! Avoid flying with this company.

Waited in line for 3 1/2 hours to re-book, only to find they could not get us to our destination for three days. They suggested we fly the next day to Newark instead, and then buy tickets down to IAD on another airline and submit a reimbursement request with TAP. We sent in the $1300 refund request on Jan 7, for 3 passengers. Today, April 12, they emailed back our refund in the form of a $200 voucher for travel with TAP! It's absolute thievery, besides being incompetent. There is no email to respond to. just their interminable web site ""customer service"". Incidentally, on the outbound flight they also lost the luggage for 6 days, and any call to TAP required at least a 45 minute wait-time to reach anyone. The bottom line is that if you ever need to reach customer service you will bitterly regret the day you decided to fly with them.

In addition, the line was continuously disconnected in the middle of a conversation, so I had to call back many times, waiting in a long queue and explaining the nature of my request to different agents.

458,tap-portugal,"✅ Trip Verified | Lisbon to Cancun. To begin with, the price of an executive ticket is not cheap, but the executive service seems to be. Shame on a Star Alliance airline, without a welcome drink: not even a water, at least.  Afterwards, the crew seems to be doing us a favor by doing the in-flight service. It is incredible that people with a lot of experience and some age, who should be professionals and set an example for the younger ones, are the opposite, who literally threw the tray to the top of the table, without the slightest care and without a word of sympathy, like please and thank you. They didn't even deign, during the flight, to stop by the cabin to see if the passengers needed anything, or if everything was fine. All orders must be made by calling the crew, or by directing me to the galley. As for the meal, it was unfortunate, because it was the same meal as a mid-course meal, and that doesn't seem normal for a 10:30 flight. The shameful starter, the main course a meat with a carrot puree, in which the carrot puree tasted like mold. I still questioned and complained to the flight attendant, but his reaction was to literally ignore my complaint, without an apology, or he could have had the attitude of apologizing and that he would see if there was any hot meal left to replace mine. The dessert, a ridiculous dimension. For a ticket of 2227 euros, the service provided was less than average, taking into account the flights carried out in other companies in business class, such as a Qatar, a Swiss or even a Lufthansa. A suggestion: send Tap crew members to one of these long-haul, executive companies, so that they can learn what a 5-star service provided to passengers is, with friendliness and professionalism. | Para começar, o preço da passagem executiva não é barato, mas o serviço executivo parece ser. Vergonha para uma companhia aérea da Star Alliance, sem uma bebida de boas-vindas: nem mesmo uma água, pelo menos. Quando um Lufthansa ou suíço, eles oferecem champanhe, água e sucos. Depois, a tripulação parece estar nos fazendo um favor ao fazer o serviço de bordo. É incrível que pessoas com muita experiência e alguma idade, que deveriam ser profissionais e dar o exemplo para os mais novos, sejam o contrário, que literalmente jogaram a bandeja em cima da mesa, sem o menor cuidado e sem palavra de simpatia, como por favor e obrigado. Nem se dignaram, durante o voo, a passar na cabine para ver se os passageiros precisavam de alguma coisa, ou se estava tudo bem. Todas as ordens devem ser feitas ligando para a tripulação ou me direcionando para a cozinha. Quanto à refeição, foi lamentável, porque era a mesma refeição que uma refeição a meio do curso, e isso não parece normal para um voo das 10:30. A entrada vergonhosa, o prato principal uma carne com purê de cenoura, em que o purê de cenoura tinha gosto de mofo. Ainda questionei e reclamei com a aeromoça, mas a reação dele foi literalmente ignorar minha reclamação, sem pedir desculpas, ou poderia ter tido a atitude de se desculpar e que veria se sobrava alguma refeição quente para substituir a minha. A sobremesa, uma dimensão ridícula. Para um bilhete de 2227 euros, o serviço prestado foi inferior à média, tendo em conta os voos realizados em outras companhias em classe executiva, como a Qatar, a Swiss ou mesmo a Lufthansa.

462,tap-portugal,"Not Verified |  We flew from LHR to LIS and there was no problem with this flight, it was on arrival in LIS that problems started. The Business Class lounge is after security but before passport control so if you want to use the lounge when in transit it means a double trip through control. The lounge itself was probably the worst I have come across. Very crowded with poor food selection and very old toilets. The gate was quite chaotic with economy class passengers having their carry on bags rejected. Why not check them at check in? It was a very crowded bus out to the aircraft and yet they were very keen on ensuring masks were kept on at all times, including on the flight. How about putting on an extra bus and ensuring social distancing? We departed on time, 10.05 and at 11.45 they served the main meal, a choice of fish, meat or pasta. My wife's fish was OK but my beef was way overdone and inedible. The front toilet was blocked off for crew use only and when the meal was cleared away by 12:30 the crew went around closing the window blinds and putting the cabin into darkness. The crew then disappeared down the back of the plane leaving 1 crew member to man several galleys. Was this flight for the benefit of the passengers to travel to Miami, or the benefit of the crew for a jolly in Miami. Yes, TAP are cheaper than other airlines but it does show and, as they say, you get what you pay for.

Even more surprised, instead of offering to check these bags free of charge, as most airlines do when the flight is full, they were charging over 80£ for it. Insane. It got worse. The trip was basically what you get from a low cost airline. No food is provided. Seat space is minimal, seats are not reclinable. And then they try to force you to buy their uber-expensive food and drinks. Last thing: Be careful with the covid documents. Even though the countries are no longer requiring tests if you're vaccinated, this airline forces you do to present a test. They don't give any official reason, since the government doesn't require this, but they do. Guess what? They have a test centre ready nearby, if you pay another 100...

This made climbing up and down stairs impossible. I notified Tap Portugal of my need of assistance more than 48hours before my flight as was requested by the airline. Unfortunately, upon arrival at the airport, no assistance was provided to me at all. I was lucky to have a friend travelling with me on the first part of the journey. No wheelchair was provided by the airline and we had to take one from the airport which was not allowed past security (we had to explain this to security and almost force our way in, so as not to be sent back to the airline check in desk!). Still no assistance at the gate or on the bus to the airplane. The pinnacle was reached in front of the airplane, when they advised me that there would be no assistance to transport me up to the airplane. The airline should usually provide a specific lift for disabled people, and none was organised. To top this off, there was torrential rain outside, and all staff at Tap Portugal watched as a kind gentleman accepted to carry me on his back up the slippery wet stairs. One should be ashamed to be working for a company with such non-existent service. Arrived at Lisbon, I insisted on not leaving my seat until assistance came, which eventually arrived. Wrong wheelchair again however. We had to place my backpack and handbag on the chair footstep to help raise my legs,  again appalling service. I am not even going to speak about the condescending attitude of each staff member in the plane and on the ground. It felt humiliating from start to end. Second flight from Lisbon to Geneva and Tap had not organised any particular seating arrangement so I could stretch my legs. I ended up crying in front of the whole airplane for flight attendants to ask people to move their seats in order to free up extra leg room.

They do not content the emails. Their internet page is almost always down, it doesn't work, it gives errors many times, and you can't complete the booking process as much as you want. But I completed it once and it didn't even pick up the bags I put in, then I had to do it over the phone and it's extremely difficult. I do not recommend anyone to travel through it. We did it because it came out in Hopper and it was the biggest mistake. They make everything difficult to be able to travel. The page system is outdated and not to mention the cell phone application, I tried to put it on and it never syncronized with my reservation on the page. The app is difficult to use, older people could not book through the page or use the app. No supervisor ever calls us, it's wasting time and when calling their phone number the first message that comes out is that if tap portgal cancels a reservation, press 1. Apparently they cancel many reservations although it is not my case at the moment.

TAP Portugal website was only displaying the information ""due to covid-19 pandemics, check with the country you are flying from, by and to what the regulations are"". I did, and I wasn't requested to show anything for my Paris to Portugal because I had my European sanitary pass. For Canada, I was requested to have a PCR test done 72hr before ""the last country you flight from"", hence, Portugal. I therefore had my test done in Paris and that would have been ready by the time I arrived in Portugal (which is what happened). Nonetheless when I tried to register in Paris airport, the TAP employee told me they will not allow me because I did not have my PCR test. Even though TAP website only indicated to comply with the countries I was traveling from, through and to, regulations, they made up a rule at the entry point, saying I had to present my test then and refuse me the boarding. They refuse to let me in the next flight even if there were seats available because I would have only 50 minutes to change plane in Lisbon. My PCR results arrived before my flight left Paris, but it was then too late to register. I had to take a plane with another airline, which cost me more than a thousand euros total and while I sent many emails to TAP following that I never got an answer.

No complimentary meal or even water was served on a 4hrs flight LIS->RAI in Premium Economy. We bought water and ordered a lasagna, the packaging, quality and taste of the food was unsatisfactory. Bottom-line: until huge improvements in the cabin service have been made we will avoid whenever possible to fly with TAP - but if you have to fly with them on a midrange plane, we recommend not to book Premium Economy as in our experience you are way better off with a regular economy seat, you can sit closer to a usable toilet and use the overhead bins.

A lot might be said about travelling during pandemic times. It is hard for passengers, and hard for crews, as well as airlines management. I would like to point out how disappointing was my first trip on the new A330Neo by TAP: Business class cabin is an extremely high density place, much more packed than on their A330-200. There are so many passengers and they are so close each other that is now a noisy place. As a consequence, seats are too narrow. And place for legs and feet were not sufficient for me. I could not move at all (seat 5A). Feeling of a magnetic resonance imaging bed. I started to feel bad. This is a typical profit targeting mistake. It is no use paying for a business class ticket, if you cannot breath. Worse: as (I suppose) a pandemic protection, business class toilet was for crew only. 34 business class pax had to share 2 toilets with 80 Economy Extra pax. I let you guess the result after a 9 hours flight, as crew never cleaned. Which is by the way, a bad decision in Covid times. My opinion is that TAP Portugal, for the first time, is offering such a downgraded product in Business Class that they will lose their most loyal ( 40 years) customers.

Before they came to our row (9), we heard she said they were out of beef. And when she came to take our order, we could choose between baccalao and spinach pasta. I should have understood that if i wanted beef, i should have ordered it online, before the flight. I told her i did not want any dinner. It took almost 1.5 hours before they cane with the drink trolley. Another stewardess offered me a beef stew that they served in a bowl. The taste was actually good, but looked boring . We had a big tv screen, and enough choices of movies. After dinner they turned of the lights, nice to relax, but do they need to keep the temperature on around 30 degrees ? Its so warm when i tried to lay down and sleep. They served a light meal one and a half hour before arrival, When we came to Punta Cana there was remote parking, and they got us in to two busses, very crowded.

This was a problem because it is cheaper to add baggage before going to the airport, however in the end we had to pay the maximum cost because we could never get a hold of customer service over the phone. At check in, we were checked in by a third party company that could not help us with any questions related to TAP Portugal. One flight was delayed and when we arrived to the connecting airport they treated us like we were responsible for the delayed flight. Then when we got to Newark they didn't have our stroller set (which included 3 seat attachments and the bassinet for our son to sleep in). No TAP representative was present in Newark to help locate the stroller or take a report of the lost stroller. Eventually when we arrived to the final destination and there was no stroller. I tried calling them many many times and I was always on hold for at least an hour or longer. When someone picked up the phone, I was transferred and then placed on hold for another hour or longer. When I messaged them on Facebook I was replied to with a generic message and no one was there to help me. I tried messaging on LinkedIn, Facebook, and received absolutely zero assistance. No one has been able to help us with our lost stroller. Even today I am trying to call them and I am on hold for hours, with receiving any help or speaking with anyone.

During boarding, they caught me for additional screening to answer questions and searching our bags and body. After the meal service they forgot to bring drinks to my row. When I asked the stewardess, she said she is busy and didn’t bother to come back. I had to ask another colleague of hers to bring us something to drink.

495,tap-portugal,"Not Verified | One of the worst experiences I have ever had. Stay away from this company especially during COVID-19, they do not offer any refund nor allow you to reschedule your flight. As many others unaware passengers, I was fooled by the claim that rescheduling was free of charge. Unfortunately, this is not only false, but TAP does not allow you to reschedule your flight either, regardless of additional fees. This means that any booking is lost. Since TAP does not have a working online service and the operators never reply to the phone, refund is not possible even if you have flight insurance. I spent over 8 hours at the phone and it is the same story: the operators do not pick up the phone or redirect you to a loop of other operators putting you on hold for hours. The outcome of this process is the charge on your phone (unless you are using a Portuguese number). You will soon notice a pattern: in the remote event that an operator replies, you are redirected to another one and so on for hours. Be aware of this and do not be accommodating, leave negative feedbacks and let them hear your voice. The scam machine does not stop to that, with very high fees (hundreds of euros) for extra-sized/weighted baggage and shady requirements, the extra fees are around the corner. Although they claim a classic 55x40x20 bag requirement, intentional random contestations are frequent and it will be difficult to prove your case unless you bring a ruler with you. Before booking with them, really consider the chance of being targeted by one of their scam loops and ending up paying more than a high-yield ticket with any other company. Seats are less comfortable when compared to other competitors in the same price range, do not have phone chargers, are very old and quite dirty. The food was plain, but it still gave me an upset stomach. Overall, this is a disastrous company without passenger assistance at any level (online, on the ground, at the phone). Do not book with them in any form: not on their website and absolutely not by agency (this would double the time you need to waste on the phone with no results). Try to skip TAP and jump to other companies when you're searching for a flight: price differences, if any, are illusory. Instead you will get disservice, lose a lot of your time and possibly several hidden fees.","""One of the worst experiences""",1,United States,5th January 2022,no
496,tap-portugal,"✅ Trip Verified | Extremely dissatisfied with this company. Stay away from TAP at any cost, the price is not worth the disservice. Do not fly with this company during the COVID-19 pandemic since they do not offer any refund for lost flights due to covid positivity. They consider any missed flight a no-show and deny any reimbursement. To do this, they rely on a loop created by the 24h requirement for most COVID tests. They will ask you to send documentation to their email address and they will not provide any reply. When the flight has passed, they will claim it as a no-show and deny refund according to their policy. Be aware and avoid this company, near-bankruptcy does not justify such embarrassing behavior. Flights are very uncomfortable, missing basic elements including phone chargers. The equipment is very old and poorly maintained. Food is poor quality, although not the worst I've had on an aircraft. On-board WI-FI does not work. The staff are unhelpful. The operators often hung up on you in order not to reply or to delay your assistance. As practical example, I spent nearly 3 hours on hold with no useful assistance. The ground staff at the airport is useless: they do not have access to any modification/change of your reservation. The online system is worthless, it does not allow modifications when they are needed, probably due to a precise intent to deny reimbursement. Fees and charges are far above average for extra baggage. A fee is charged for extra size and weight which can potentially add up to hundreds of euros per baggage. Although this information is not clearly accessible on TAP website, it can be found online from other sources. In summary, avoid this company at any cost. There are many other companies with similar prices that offer a better service. Do not book with this company during the COVID-19 pandemic since they do not offer any refund on tickets. Due to general disservice it may also be unsafe and dangerous to travel with them. In the unfortunate event that you have already booked a flight with them, basic survival tips include: do not check-in your bags at the airport to minimize the contact with the staff. Instead, check every bag online and go directly to the gate: due to the poor service, no scales or meters are available at the gate and it's more likely to avoid tricks on the baggage. For COVID-related refunds there is almost nothing to do, be careful not to get it so that they cannot capitalize on your sickness. In any case, communicate with them by certified email with confirmation receipt and never leave a phone call without any email confirmation. As a final note, do not leave any positive feedback on the phone surveys until you have your issue completely resolved (which will most likely never happen). This is a final trick they use to deny you proper treatment and make it result as a positive feedback: when they bounce you around between operators or ask you to call back, leave no feedback or a negative feedback after the call.","""Extremely dissatisfied with this company""",1,United States,4th January 2022,no

499,tap-portugal,"Not Verified | TAP Portugal was the worst airline experience I have ever had the misfortune of flying on. Upon arriving at the gate of my connecting flight, two hours in advance, I was told that my American vaccine pass would not work and only EU passes were accepted. I had read every email sent to me, visited the website several times, and even looked up if American vaccine passes were allowed. I was forced to sprint through the airport with the many other people that were turned away and go to take a covid test. The covid test was in terminal 1 (we were in terminal 5). We were then forced to pay $400 to get a test to board the plane. I barely made it back before the gates closed. Many passengers missed the flight. Upon arriving in Portugal (my connecting destination) the plane took more than an hour to de-board. We were then all forced on to buses and driven to the airport which was not a short distance away. By the time I got to my connecting flight, I still had thirty minutes before the flight took off, however, they had shut the doors and didn’t let any of the people from my connection onto the flight as it was already overbooked. This caused me to miss the train I had paid for and my Airbnb check-in time. I went to the help desk as I was frustrated with the situation and all they said was that I could contact them through a link on their website. I never heard back after several attempts to contact them. TAP Portugal also had different rules at different airports. For example: we were required to buy surgical masks as opposed to cloth masks after not having to wear them for several flights. This made flying extremely unreliable and I never knew what to expect. To make matters worse, the Portugal airport is completely incompetent. They don’t give gate information until 90mins before the flight takes off and you have to go through a passport check once receiving that information. This makes it so 100s of people are standing in a line angry and trying to rush to get to their gates because many were missing their flights. People were cutting in line which made other passengers mad. The passport checkers ended up having to calm people down and stop people from cutting in line which made the process twice as long. Also, the airport had several long escalators broken. This gets very frustrating while running through the airport with heavy bags or things like strollers. Overall I would not recommend TAP airline or the Portugal airport to anyone. It was an unbelievably frustrating experience that cost time and money in the end.

I was forced to wait in 3 different long lines for a total of 5 hrs, just to be told that because I was a no show, I had to pay a $1200 fee. I informed the Emirates representative of what happened and they became rude and walked away. After 5 hrs I was able to speak to someone who understood situation and got me a next morning flight for my destination of Male. Upon receiving my new flight I was stranded in the airport for 17hrs before my 2:30am flight. On my original flight I paid for a extra legroom seat, but on the rescheduled flight I was forced to sit in a standard seat that really hurt my legs. After taking the grueling flight to Male, my luggage never came. I reported the incident to Male airport staff and they started an investigation for my luggage. I finally was able to take a transfer to maldives, but without any clothes or luggage. This entire situation ruined my vacation because this was over the weekend.

But #Emirates had already cancelled our next flight after an hr into our seven 7 hr flight, this was 6 hrs before landing. Once we landed there was no crew waiting so we ran to catch the connection until mid-way the #Emirates personnel appeared telling us about the cancellation. They're rude and ignorant to the fact that we were sleep deprived, tired and could not grasp why no effort was made to make up for the 1 hour delay or contact the ground crew. Also both my partner & I had picked up a cold virus (not Covid, got the negative PCR) and felt horrible. We were both feverish, barely managing to speak and the crew treated us poorly. First they gave us seats far away from each other twice. I couldn't understand how they could make the same mistake twice. Second they told us we can't get the exit row seat, we'd paid extra for. They told me, it wasn't their responsibility to refund the money and I should request if from Emirates.  I just requested that we wouldn't be seated near any small babies and they said fine. They kept telling us to collect our luggage, but with the condition my partner and I were in and the fact that my feet had already started swelling up, it was impossible. So we said no. Since no one was helping and it was 3 am, we thought to go and check in to our hotel & sleep. We were already at our limits but thought we make the best of it, go visit the Dubai Expo and all. But things just started getting worst. We were in nightmarish state until we got home. We had to walk for an hour to get to the shuttle that would take us to the hotel. The Emirates crew at the Airport entrance couldn't help us with Expo tickets, cause they didn't care. We had been given one meal voucher per person for 24 hours. And the hotel had no amenities. After multiple arguments, the meal problem was fixed, which wasn't that useful cause the quality of the food was so bad that all the passengers in the hotel were ordering deliveries. We'd to go and buy clothes, toothbrush, deodorant, etc for ourselves which was a waste of money. The hotel couldn't even be rated at 2 stars and there was always at least one person arguing and shouting with the staff and complaining. We survived the whole ordeal and got to the plane to find couple of things that we were assured were fine, were actually not. We ended being seated beside a baby that cried for 10 hours of our flight without exaggeration, there were empty seats at the end of the plane, they just didn't bother to check for us.

There was very little communication about what problem, if any, caused the delay. Ultimately, Emirates did begin check-in and then began a shuffle of repeated delays until, about seven hours later, Emirates cancelled the flight. Very little communication. ""Maybe there will be a flight tomorrow."" Called Emirates and no answer. Tried online chat without success. Ultimately turned to twitter to get rebooked (had onward flight). This in turn led to the agent trying to charge me an additional several thousand dollars because of fare differential between flying days. I pushed back hard on that, but got the sense Emirates simply sought to profit. Agent tried to put me on a flight in which I would miss my connection to a city served only once every five days by air. Emirates, unlike other airlines, won't book passengers on cancelled flights onto other airlines. Ultimately, Emirates added an additional flight the following day. Told us to get to airport four hours before, but then wouldn't check-in rebooked flight until two hours before so the two flights wouldn't get confused (why then have us in area with no seats and tell us to just stand there for several hours?). Onboard, seats were cramped. My child got a ""kids meal"" she didn't ask for which consisted of one burnt chicken nugget! Service was lackluster.

We turned up to the airport and the flight did not exist. There was no help desk at the airport, their App was down and we couldn't get through to customer service in Oman or the UAE. We tried calling customer service in the UK, and were still not put through to anyone 40 minutes later. Bearing in mind, we were having to use our UK mobiles abroad. We had another British couple come up to us who hear our conversation and were going through exactly the same thing.

In the end we had to rent a car to drive over the border as there weren't any flights to the UAE for 12 hours and we did not want to spend the night in the airport when I was six months pregnant. We tried to complain in Dubai & we were told they couldn't do anything, we had to report it via the website upon completion of our full trip when we arrived back in the UK. I lodged a complaint & we have just received the below response, which takes no accountability and tries to pass the buck to FlyDubai. Firstly, they are part of the same group and secondly, we booked our tickets through Emirates & they took full payment for the whole itinerary. Therefore, we are their customer & we are nothing to do with FlyDubai. They offered us a measly 10,000 miles each, which costs them nothing & is completely worthless since their restructure of airmiles a few years ago. You need a min. 50-100K to upgrade. Emirates response: Thank for your correspondence and naturally, I regret to learn that you were affected by a schedule change and that you only found out when you arrived at the airport. I do appreciate the inconvenience you were caused, especially as I understand that you are pregnant. If I may explain that you booked a ticket which included two different airlines. Although there is a partnership, Emirates and FlyDubai are two separate companies and Emirates have no control over the operation of their flights and vice versa. In this instance, the schedule change occurred to your flight from Muscat operated by FlyDubai; whilst I am not aware why their proposed flight EK2033 on 5 November was removed from their schedules in advance of travel, I would like to explain that unfortunately, there are rare occasions when these cannot be avoided due to operational or commercial requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. That being said, I note that you experienced difficulties when you tried to contact us and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of Emirates, as well as our partner FlyDubai. Whilst we are unable to offer any reimbursement of expenses incurred as a consequence of a cancellation of a flight operated by another airline, I would suggest you contact your private travel insurers, as standard travel insurance policies usually cover such situations. Nevertheless, as a gesture on our part to apologise for the negative impression you have been left with on this occasion, I have credited 10,000 goodwill miles to both your Skywards accounts.

Upon checking in for our first flight with Emirates, the supervisor said I needed a visa since I was a USA citizen. We attempted to explain that Philippines allows a visa on arrival for foreign spouses traveling with their Filipino spouse under the Balikbayan program. We showed our original apostilled marriage certificate as proof. However, the supervisor stated their system did not list these other provisions. We attempted to show multiple IATF resolutions that the Balikbayan had been allowed for several months, but she stated their system was updated daily. We agreed to follow up during normal business hours since this was Friday night. When I asked for documentation regarding my offloading, the supervisor indicated she couldn't provide this and that I'd have to make an online complaint. We were able to confirm by phone and email from the Bureau of Immigration that I should be allowed entry with my wife. We then showed this documentation to different Emirates supervisors at the airport who expressed confusion as to why I was prohibited to board in the first place. They agreed to independently confirm with Emirates airport staff in Philippines and the airport immigration officials. After they did, the airport supervisors confirmed we could rebook our flights and I would be able to board. We incurred thousands of dollars of extra travel expenses while obtaining this confirmation. And our connecting airlines refused to refund us our tickets without documentation as to why I was prohibited to board. When I requested this documentation from the online complaint system, I did not receive a clear response about the matter for 10 days. And that response added that the Balikbayan program didn't apply to me since I wasn't a Filipino even though I had already provided them emails from the Philippines BOI and the Emirates airport staff confirming I should be allowed to travel. I spent the next month continuing to email, resubmit documentation, and call anyone at Emirates who'd listen without any success.

No customer should be told that they cannot rebook with another airline after an airline has breached they ticket contract or else they would not receive a hotel voucher. I believe this is the era of choice? The customer doesn’t put themselves in the unfortunate position of an airline being in breach of their airline ticket. And should a customer then choose another airline to reach their destination, the airline should know that the customer did not choose to have to rebook a flight. Nevertheless, the flight a customer chooses should be entirely up to them, given the option. Emirates should never try to hold people hostage after they mess up!

The reason given for cancellation was “mechanical “ but this seemed a stock response without any details to back it up. No alternative flight options could be offered although the agent did try. Consequently, we were a unable to make our flight from JFK to LHR and had to overnight which was a great inconvenience due to work and school commitments. JetBlue were unwilling to offer any hotel room and suggested we make a claim for the hotel costs afterwards. I suspect if we got anything at all it would be a travel voucher which is useless to us!

Very unhappy with my Jetblue experience. Round trip flight started out with a 2hour delay that turned into more than 3 hours. Our lay over was already 5hrs so we were in JFK for more than 8hrs. Everyone knows more time in an airport means more money spent on food/drinks with a 500% inflation price. We thought for sure once we got on the plan at least our meals and ear phones would have been free. Instead we got a 50$ credit for a future flight. Our flight back was more than equally subpar compared to this. Again started with a 2hr delay. Connecting flight at JFK. The delay made it so we would have 10min to get from gate 20 to gate 2 in terminal 5 at JFK which is relatively close. We decided to check our luggage so we would have less to carry in order to transition from gate to gate quickly. We were told they knew we were coming and would wait. So we ran to the next gate and arrived before take off but the plane took off early and left us. This delayed us to the next day, next flight would not be leaving until 1200. We were booked a room over night and told to pick up our luggage at the baggage claim. After waiting patiently for 30 min at carousel 5, Our luggage never came. Another customer service person told us they did not know why we were told to pick up our luggage. This posed a problem for us as we had prescription medications in our checked baggage and we were told we would have to wait 2 hrs to get our luggage. At this point it was past midnight and we could not wait this long with two young kids. So we called for the shuttle service to the hotel and waited again patiently for 30 min, we decided to call again, turns out the shuttle picked up one passenger and left even though he was told we had four in our party.

Unfortunately it appears to be an issue with the management of the planes and crew. The online customer service was helpful to a bare minimum. I asked multiple questions that went unanswered. The was a canned response given by the live customer service rep that was repeated used. Now I am sitting near the gate in a terminal filled with flights. All of these flights are delayed by a minimum of 1hour. This was a similar situation one week prior. I would not recommend this airline. I only flew once with jetblue 2 years ago in 2019 without any issue. Today JetBlue does not seem to have a handle on their scheduling across the entire east coast. The most common response for the reason of delays has been crew issues. Some responses are initially weather but then develop with further questioning to crew related issues.

I was 1K with them for years, but I let that lapse because I felt flying United was a terrible experience given almost 100% of the time I felt like the product, not the customer. In this most recent case, United once again made us late for our arrival to Calgary. Then, we had to wait over an hour to receive our baggage. By that point, the car I hired to drive me to my family 120 minutes away had left given they had other passengers, thus abandoning me in Calgary. Not surprisingly, United refused to help citing that once a passenger arrives at their final location, they no longer have to compensate for poor service. United’s sub-par service on this flight alone cost me over $600 USD to take a taxi to meet my family at one AM. In aggregate, United does a fantastic job of financial damage control by refusing to compensate for their terrible service, thus ensuring a better financial bottom line for share holders, fully accepting the hit to their reputation. If you fly another airline such as Delta and then compare the experiences, sadly the disparity is massive, and United looks even worse.

There were two passengers traveling and one was 70 years old and had accessibility needs and United had confirmed wheelchair. Due to reroute they were redirected to SFO and there was no one available to push the wheelchair and another passenger was made to push the wheelchair! Due to all these delays, COVID tests expired and we had to re-do COVID test at Newark airport which costed us another $250. United hasn't reimbursed us to date.

The first leg of my flight was Austin to Newark. We landed, and the pilot told us that we were behind a few other planes that needed to get to the gate. We ended up sitting on the tarmac in the plane for over an hour, and I had a connecting flight that I barely made. Because of that delay, my bag got left in the original plane and was not transferred over. The flight attendants on the Providence flight were visibly annoyed with me…for the gate delay I did not cause. Once I landed in Providence, I quickly realized that my suitcase did not make it to the destination. I walked upstairs to ticketing to talk to a representative there, and ended up with three people “pitching in” to help me. One lady, who was definitely not there to be helpful but didn’t seem to have anywhere else to go, got after me for not having my baggage tag/receipt. I told her I was not given one, and she repeated that it was my fault. I tried to clarify that I was not given a tag from the person that took my bag, and she raised her voice and began talking over me. It was a full day of paying for the privilege to have United workers bitch at me. After several calls, and begging, and chat messages, I finally found out that my bag arrived at the Providence airport around 930 last night.

All this to say I still somehow made it before the noted departure time to be told rudely by their staff ""yes"" the flight departed as a reply to me asking does the monitor show correctly that this flight has departed. She than continued with an attitude to state we waited for two passengers. I simply just cannot see how to be honest. Despite it being a few minutes still to the noted departure the flight was gone? Her response tone was rude and obnoxious. They plain out just don't care for customer service/satisfaction. You are just a money sign to the company.

When we got to the airport we boarded the flight a little late and took our seats on the plane. We sat for at least 40 min before the pilot told us that our plane was on fire and we needed to leave the plane. We unboarded and waited about an hour outside the terminal for them to give us a report. They told us that we have no plane to give you, and we needed to leave the terminal so the next flight could arrive on time. We were sent back to where we checked in our bags to retrieve them, and then we waited about 3 hours in a line to get on a bus to our destination. Now normally, things happen, planes combust, 1 instance is fine. It is a pain waiting around, but things happen, and although it took a full day away from our vacation and they refused to pay for our room (or do anything to make up for their plane caring on fire) things could be worse. On our way home, our first flight went as planned with no problem, and I forgot about the fire plane. The next flight was a red eye for us, so I was already irritated enough, but the plane on board software malfunctioned, so we sat for 2 extra hours on the plane before taking off and had to absolutely sprint to our next gate which we had planned to eat at. When we boarded our 3rd and final plane we sat around again for an hour past our estimated departure time, then we were asked to leave the plane again as it had maintenance problems. We will likely take a bus home as well, and I will have spent more time on a bus then on a United flight.

One month before our travel plans I received a message saying our departing aircraft was returning to Boston a full day later than we had booked for. Our 4 hour flight was now turning into an overnighter and 14 hour trip with 3 connecting airplanes to catch. I had hotel and car reservations that I was paying for in Boston for the day we had planned for. I lost almost $1000 on these plans alone. I contacted United and spoke with a very nice woman who helped me use their customer service tool to request reimbursement for my ""significantly changed flight"". I was reimbursed my trip at the assurance that I was still booked for the flight (I asked the woman about this several times throughout our conversation). She assured me that because United could not book me on another flight because there were none scheduled, I was entitled to my money back for my flight because of significant unavoidable changes to our trip. After checking one final time that I was still in fact booked for my flight, we hung up and I received my refund a few weeks later. Fast forward to the last day of our trip. I call United because I did not see a check in option for my flight and now my confirmation code won't work. Come to find out the United representative cancelled my reservation and I was without a flight and stuck in Utah. I gave this agent everything I had: case numbers from customer service, the name of the original agent I spoke with, dates, emails and she did not care to acknowledge any of it. She said ""I am sorry the agent gave you false information but you must buy your ticket for tomorrow on this flight at current market value"". Not only was my flight canceled on me, they charged me $900 dollars for a flight I originally purchased at $400. I informed the woman that on their website it says that United will reimburse for ""significant travel delays"". The original agent I spoke with quoted a delay of 6 hours as a significant delay which mine ended up being 14 hours by the time all was said and done. This United supervisor did not care to hear any of it and several times in our conversation just stopped answering me. All she had to say is that United doesn't reimburse a flight if you still get on the flight, which is a complete lie.

653,air-canada,"✅ Trip Verified |  It’s important for Air Canada to revise the connections they offer for long distance flights as there is not enough time to arrive and go through all the stages (customs, baggage security check and walking on a reasonable pace to reach the terminal gate you will be flying from) without feeling stressed that you will miss the connection. I arrived in Montreal at 6:05am and my boarding time was 6:55am to Vancouver. There is always some delay after the landing and all the passengers being able to get their carryons and leave the plane. Before customs we were blocked by this very rude lady that was demanding the “ArriveCAN” receipt and people were having hard time to find while she was screaming that we didn’t have it, but we would not be allowed to board if we didn’t show it to the Air Canada attendant in Sao Paulo. After that you need to pass by the borders and it always take some time. It's never fast. Documents checked you need to head to a different area of the airport to pass security to connect flights. It’s better walk fast, or run with all your luggage otherwise you won’t have a chance. Once I got at the security, there was this huge line that I knew I would not make it if I didn’t talk to someone that I had a flight departing in less than 10 minutes. I approached this lady that seemed to be working at the security department and her first reaction was, very rudely, telling me that I was supposed to be in the Airport 3 hours earlier, and there was nothing she could do…that was my fault. When I tried to explain that I had just arrived from Sao Paulo and it was not me that decided the connections she put me on a different line (a little shorter). Security took longer.  After running with my bags half opened trying to find the gate of my flight, my only thoughts were that us customers pay a very expensive price and shouldn’t to go through this experience ever. I understand that, Air Canada has no responsibility on the rudeness of some of the airport workers in Montreal but the company needs to assure their customers have time to make to their seats on the plane.

The lady at Lufthansa called customer service and asked about my reservation with Air Canada. She said they were able to find it, but they changed the ticket from Air Canada to Lufthansa. After boarding flight LH 0470 all passengers had to wait almost 2 hours inside the plane since they were bringing in the food (catering). Because the flight was delayed I missed my connection in Toronto going to San Francisco. When I arrived in Toronto it was a mess; all of those who lost connections were told to go to different places, some were told to go to Air Canada Customer service, others were asked to go through security and then to the information booth. I spoke to a lady who said that Air Canada was understaffed and there was supposed to be someone helping those who lost connections after we left the plane. There was nobody helping and all the staff members seemed clueless as to what to do. At least 13 passengers were in the same situation as me. We had lost our connections and since we arrived at 7pm instead of 5pm and there were no other flights to our destinations. All of us who lost connections went through security and had to enter Canada to be able to get to the information booth at the entrance of the airport as they had told us to go. When trying to explain our situation to staff there, they would send us somewhere else or tell us to call customer service. I have traveled many times and this is the most disorganized experience I have had. We decided to wait next to the information booth and not move until someone came to help us. They tried to send us away and have us call customer service, but we did not have anywhere to go so we stayed there until someone came. We waited at the information booth and started calling the operator to get staff from Air Canada to help us. We needed to book new flights and we needed a place to stay for that night. We were in the airport for over 3 hours, until a group of people came to help and told us they were sending us to the Marriott hotel for that night. They gave us one voucher for dinner and one for breakfast and sent us away. We were at the airport from 7pm to 10pm then got sent to the hotel. I booked my new flight for noon the next day and asked if I needed to take a new covid test. Nobody had that information. Finally I decided to go to sleep at midnight and figure it out the next morning. In the morning I found that there was a Covid testing site at the airport and went to take the test.

We got all of our COVID test done on New Years Eve as we were traveling on New Year's Day, got to the airport in plenty of time(t3 hours ahead) and the incompetence was just mind boggling but we got through and told our bags would be checked all the way through to Orlando as we would pre-clear customs in Montreal and then head to Orlando. Well this is where it went batshit crazy. Our flight out of Vancouver was delayed by an hour we got into Montreal and Air Canada lost one of our bags so we were held up in US immigration because we couldn't clear customs without that one bag (which was mine) of course my family didn't leave me we all were stuck. At the last minute the agent filed a missing bag for to allow us to go through he then called the flight attendant on the plane we were scheduled to leave on and she was so rude and refused to hold the plane for five minutes so my family and I could run the 100m dash to the gate. We got through finally and yes they left us even though it was their fault we missed the connection. Had to trek down to the baggage department with absolutely do direction or help from Air Canada. We finally got back to the departures in Montreal after collecting our remaining bags and a bit of luck we ended up with an agent that was actually concerned and nice for the first time in this whole ordeal. She booked us on a flight in the morning and she arranged to put us up at a near by Marriott and $80 in meal vouchers she was amazing, it gave me hope. Got back to the hotel in Montreal only to get an email that the flight she booked us on in the morning was cancelled and we are now being bumped on to a Delta Flight through Atlanta into Orlando.

The way the passengers affected were treated from the time we got off the aircraft to the time we were re-booked on another flight the following day was horrible. They have good customer-facing people who are doing their best to deal with such situations, but as a major organization, their leadership never gives them the tools or budget to deal with it appropriately. They need to make major improvements in dealing with crisis situations as they occur. Increased authority at a mid-level management would certainly be a good first step. The managers appear to be doing their best to accomodate the stressful transitioning of customers throughout the airport, but they clearly lack discretionary budgets to keep customers comfortable during the process. No food, drink or emergency staff increases to deal with any of it.

I wondered if this might be due to travel fatigue after laying over from IAH on the fourth of four sectors. In-flight catering was my big issue with SQ on this trip. The flight time from MAN-SIN-MAN is longer due to the war in Ukraine and Russian airspace being closed - I reckon at least two hours more. I was a bit frustrated that the two meals were on opposite ends of that 14 hours. The lack of a printed menu (due to Covid - which I couldn’t understand as these have always been printed and distributed fresh anyway) meant that half way through the first 14 hours I actually paid for a bit of internet access, so I could see what refreshments were on offer (it was supposed to be free to do this, but I couldn’t work it out - although in hindsight, I should have just asked!). I was so hungry - the meals, refreshment and alcohol servings were just way too small. Entertainment is great, and the upgrade IFE since I last flew SQ a while back was nice.

Users of Changi will know the security for flights at Changi is typically at the individual Departure Gate. Unlike at other airports where it tends to be before entering the Terminal. At Terminal 3 they've decided to do all the security for 4 gates, you are then in this little pig pen with 3 other flights, potentially 1500 people, it's not big enough. The lines for the different flights cross each other, and there is little by way of organisation. No one seemed to be in charge, when I politely mentioned it didn't seem very organised I was met with a blank stare. I didn't expect this at Changi Airport.

Flight was at 00:30 hours, so there was no dinner, shortly after takeoff we went to lights out, with breakfast to be served 3 hours out of Melbourne. Meanwhile the hostesses came round on a regular basis with glasses of water. Breakfast arrived, lightly cooked sausages, scrambled egg, beans, and some nasty pasta tomato sauce, that smells of capsicum. The egg seemed to consist of only yoke, a small spoonful was enough to confirm it wasn't fit for consumption. I'm a keen airline food eater, I enjoy the tray format, and I'm not too fussy, but this was inedible. I complained and asked for the alternative, vermicelli noodles with some stir fried chicken. It wasn't great, too much vermicelli and not enough sauce, but it was adequate. An hour or so later, a senior hostess came and chatted with me, and asked me what was wrong, I described the egg, she said someone else had also complained, I thanked her for asking me. I had an extremely good Nasi Lemak going up to Bangkok from Singapore on January 8th with Scoot, so the Changi kitchens can produce good food, and needless to say Singapore is famous for its food.

718,singapore-airlines,"✅ Trip Verified |  I've got to say that my experience flying Melbourne – Singapore and Singapore – Melbourne have completely turned me off Singapore Airlines. Their new fit outs of their A350s have reduced the seat pitch and the seats are a step back in quality. The cushioning is very thin and hard which is uncomfortable and the seats themselves are poorly constructed. The seat in front of me would buckle and bend every time the average size person in it moved which meant my knees copped a pounding given they were crammed up against the seat because of the reduction in space.  These new seats negate SIA from being a feasible selection as an airline for me. Thankfully the plane from Singapore to Manchester had not suffered the same upgrade and was a reminder of how bad the Melbourne – Singapore update is.  The meals were also underwhelming compared to pre-pandemic with very basic options and accompaniments. It took them 3 hours after take off to provide food and remove the trays due to having only one trolley cart servicing each aisle in the economy cabin. The whole experience very much smacked of an airline that has been taken over by bean-counters and they are cutting costs at every turn possible with cramming more people on the plane and providing less food and staff, and ultimately an experience that is a shade of SIA's glory days pre-pandemic.","""seats are a step back in quality""",3,Australia,14th January 2022,no

That face with Singapore Airlines flexibility claim of change of flights on their website, made me booking a flight with a 16h layover. Unfortunately, things were not looking good about a month ago, and I tried to change my flights to a short layover. I tried to contact SQ via its change of flight form for Covid related reasons through their website. 5 requests over the span of a month remain unanswered till today, complaint emails were also not replied to. I also tried to contact SQ through their callcenter, was placed in a loop for hours. After getting through after days of trying, I was told that there were seats available for the same booking class and I would be informed once the the ticket would be re-issued. So far so good. An hour later I was called, saying that this „special fare ticket“ can only be changed if if I pay this and that in addition, which ended up to a ridiculous amount, and I declined. So I was back to square and had to endure a 16h stay at Changi airport. SQ does not honor their claim of ticket flexibility. Other carrier I flew during the pandemic were willing honor their flexibility claims. The flights themselves were rather unremarkable, not as polished as Qatar, with no dining on demand offered.

726,singapore-airlines,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was flying in the worst of times as Omircon had just been detected, yet despite all the restrictions and requirements to fly to Indonesia, Singapore Airlines on its own was not a good choice for a long flight. I had flown SA for many short hauls in Asia, but the discomfort on this trip was due to the routing, the business class set-up, the time in which this route took off, and the poor communication that is truly what SA seems to thrive on, the latter being years of frustration with flying with them; One can never get a person to speak with whether in Asia, NYC or LA. I had over 400K miles therefore I was getting award tickets, in business class, which I have flown for over 40 years consistently. The only ticket available for mileage went through Frankfurt, which meant I had to leave the plane (after 6 hours, middle of the night, but too early in Europe to have any of the lounges open), go through transit and feel like a zombie. (thank you Canada Air for being open and having showers!) But let's talk about the poor design of business class and lack of comfort. These were not staggered seating, so there was no privacy, the ""bed"" could not be done by mere mortals pushing buttons, its construction was convoluted and byzantine, such that an attendant had to physically configure the flat bed and mattress etc. So uncomfortable, as one had to contort oneself to actual fit the length. In the staggered layouts they are already at an angle. Any other flat bed can easily go from seat to bed with button pushing. I have flown to Asia and back from the USA no less than 50-60 times in the last decade and the choices of airlines with better routes and greater comfort, such as JAL, Qatar, Cathay and years ago even Malaysia Air. I don't understand why this airline gets such high marks? I know their agenda: to extend their reach and become a premier European carrier. I will continue to fly SA in Asia for very short hauls, but if I decide to go to Vietnam after many months in delightful Indonesia, it will not be on SA. I have other qualms, but let's face it, flying during this particular phase of the pandemic, with non-stop testing, non-stop mask wearing, abbreviated services, and less perks were not enough to make me stop traveling, but I thought, ""Well, I am in good hands"". The flying itself was lovely, (that was 21 hours, not counting stops in Frankfurt + Singapore). Good Grief!

730,singapore-airlines,"✅ Trip Verified |  I fear for the future of airline travel when airlines appear to use the excuse of covid19 to reduce both the level and quality of service, especially for an airline previously renowned for its 1st class operation like Singapore Airlines. I was bitterly disappointed in my recent flying experience with them; from poor quality food to reduced service levels. The crew was still wonderful, but that can't make up for the overall feeling I was left with. Forget your business class comfort pack (in my view, covid19 is not a reasonable excuse for why this has been dropped), you now need to take your own eye patches/earplugs to be able to sleep if you are prone to light/sound. Instead, you'll receive a covid19 kit so you can clean your own cabin area. Meals were of such poor quality that I wished I had brought my own sandwiches. No menus are available so you have to try and listen to rather badly-pronounced meal choices to make your selection. I chose chicken and rice which turned out to be bland and gristly, with practically uncooked chicken skin (see photos). Apparently, the different meal choice of the passenger to my left did not go down well as they also left theirs untouched. My breakfast choice; scrambled eggs and sausage were served practically cold. Excessive amounts of plastic being used in meal preparation is also very disappointing in a world trying on the whole to reduce plastic. This is hands-down the worst experience in business class that I have ever experienced and was compounded by the overly-officious ground staff yelling at us (in hazmat-like suits) to walk in single file as we were marched to a 'holding area' rather than a business class lounge. In this holding area, not even water was on offer. Other lines of passengers transiting on different flights were ordered to stand against the wall whilst our group passed by.

The company touted customers' ability to change their flights for free, even being able to change a flight for free and having one free change after September 30, which would allow them to delay their flight well into 2022. I was able to easily change the flight until mid-September. After that point, I wasn't allowed to change it online and needed to call in which required over 1 hour of waiting. In September I could have changed my return flight to far into the future. In fact, the return leg of my flight was 2 months and 1 day after the initial flight. When I called in to push my flight date back, the customer service agent said I must upgrade my flight to rebook and that there was a minimum required stay of 2 months, meaning I couldn't have a the return leg of the flight more than two months after the initial one. First of all, my return flight was already more than 2 months later and before they restricted online flight changes, I could have changed my flight to much later dates.  The agent also told me the flight change would cost over 900 USD, more than the original round-trip ticket. I requested to speak to a manager. She denied my request and said she would talk to her team. After 30 minutes of being on hold, she said I could book my flight a maximum of one month past the current return date. This was not part of the agreement when I originally booked the flight. Now, however, I didn't need to upgrade the flight for some reason, but the change would cost 490 USD.
